The N status of the fynbos and strandveld ecosystems is elevated by the invasion of alien acacias. The results for P cycling are equivocal and P availability does not appear to limit plant growth in the strandveld. This study showed that the invasion of the coastal lowlands of the SW Cape by alien acacias results in an increase in the N status of fynbos, and to a lesser extent that of the strandveld, during the early stages of invasion. In conclusion, during the early stages of invasion, alien Acacia spp. increase the N status of both fynbos and strandveld ecosystems, which may result in changes in the growth form composition of adjacent indigenous vegetation, particularly the understorey species. On the other hand, no strong evidence was found to suggest that acacia invasion increases the P status of these ecosystems.

However, the density of nectarivorous birds decreased with increasing A. cyclops infestation as a result of the elimination of their food plants (proteaceous and ericaceous shrubs).  Moreover, monthly bird density did not differ significantly between plots (Friedman Test X2 5 = 9,0 N.S.).

However, R. lucida showed an apparently rare combination of unchanged maximum photosynthetic rate (A max) and increased apparent quantum yield (at) under shaded conditions.  The major constraint to photosynthesis in the otherwise well-adapted alien-shaded individuals of R. lucida appeared to be stomatal lags in response to rapid changes in light, and an inappropriate diurnal stomatal rhythm. This limitation in R.lucida, together with the lower respiratory costs incurred by shaded R. glauca, suggest that R. glauca was the better adapted of the two species to deep shade conditions beneath the alien canopy. This advantage may be accentuated by an apparent lack of competition for soil water resources between R. glauca and the alien.",Medium,"Only 24 leaves looked at. Within an area of approximately

Acacia dealbata,Silver wattle,Spain,Galicia,(6) Poisoning/ toxicity,MN - Minor,"We found that there were significant differences in respiration and net photosynthetic rates between the control and
A. dealbata extracts in all test species. The respiration rate was increased by both canopy leachate and
macerate extracts on certain collection dates, but net photosynthetic rate was stimulated by macerate and inhibited by canopy leachate on other dates. The main phenological stages of A. dealbata in which respiration and net photosynthetic rates were more affected were blossoming, inflorescence formation and in periods after severe drought, in this decreasing order. Our results also showed that Dicranum sp., Leucobryum sp. and D. glomerata were more affected by aqueous extracts than other species during a 2-year period. The respiration rate of all of the test species was
significantly affected by A. dealbata extracts. For all test species, the canopy leachate and branch
macerate had a significant effect on net photosynthesis
rate on at least one collection date.",Low,"Experiments done under laboratory conditions, not natural conditions. Impacts on plants found with or surrounding A. dealbata studied. Allelopathy said to be only partly responsible for effects. Population effect not tested.","Was suggest that the observed inhibitory or stimulatory effects on the physiological parameters studied could have an adverse effect on the understory species, and that allelopathic interference seems to participate in this process. This means that the effects
observed on these physiological parameters by Acacia
extracts would not be due to ion concentration, but
probably due to organic chemical compounds in
solution. The allelopathic phenomena could be, at
least partially, responsible for the observed effects. With regard to the net photosynthesis rate, this was
stimulated by the branch macerate, but was reduced
by treatment with canopy leachate.","Hedera hibernica (G. Kirchn.) Bean, Dicranum sp., Dactylis glomerata L., Leucobryum sp.","Four native understory species were used as test species

Abstract
Invasiveness and the impacts of introduced plants are known to be mediated by plant-microbe interactions. Yet, the microbial communities associated with invasive plants are generally poorly understood. Here we report on the first comprehensive investigation of the bacterial and fungal communities inhabiting the rhizosphere and the surrounding bulk soil of a widespread invasive tree, Acacia dealbata. Amplicon sequencing data indicated that rhizospheric microbial communities differed significantly in structure and composition from those of the bulk soil. Two bacterial (Alphaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria) and two fungal (Pezizomycetes and Agaricomycetes) classes were enriched in the rhizosphere compared with bulk soils. Changes in nutritional status, possibly induced by A. dealbata, primarily shaped rhizosphere soil communities. Despite a high degree of geographic variability in the diversity and composition of microbial communities, invasive A. dealbata populations shared a core of bacterial and fungal taxa, some of which are known to be involved in N and P cycling, while others are regarded as plant pathogens. Shotgun metagenomic analysis also showed that several functional genes related to plant growth promotion were overrepresented in the rhizospheres of A. dealbata. Overall, results suggest that rhizosphere microbes may contribute to the widespread success of this invader in novel environments.

Introduction
Invasive trees are a global concern because they pose a direct threat to natural ecosystems and cause important economic losses, although they also provide goods and services that sustain human populations1. Australian acacias are among the most invasive trees worldwide2. In their invasive ranges, acacias have had numerous and severe environmental impacts3, 4. For example, Acacia dealbata (silver wattle) is an aggressive invader in southern Europe, the Americas and southern Africa2. In South Africa, this species reduces water availability5, and alters faunal6 and microbial7 community diversity and composition. Acacia dealbata also reduces the abundance and cover of native plant species under its understory8 and modifies soil basal respiration and soil enzymatic activities9, two important proxies for ecosystem functioning.

Plant species traits (e.g., high seed outputs, adaptability), abiotic factors (e.g., similar climate and soil chemistry in native and invaded ranges), native range biogeography, and deliberate and accidental human intervention10, have been commonly used to explain why many acacia species have become invasive in new environments11.

It is also likely that rhizosphere microbes (native or introduced), such as bacteria and fungi, play an important role in the establishment and invasion success of acacias12. Microbial communities influence many important ecosystem processes, including plant nutrient acquisition and nitrogen and carbon cycling13, which regulate plant diversity and productivity. For example, acacias develop symbiotic associations with rhizobia that convert atmospheric nitrogen into plant available ammonium14. Recent work has shown that invasive acacias in South Africa’s Cape Floristic Region (CFR) associate with a diverse assemblage of Bradyrhizobium strains that are not commonly associated with native legumes15. Acacias also interact with arbuscular mycorrhizal (AMF) and/or ectomycorrhizal (EMF) fungi16 which modify the root system and enhance mobilization and the uptake of several essential elements, especially phosphorus17. On the other hand, microbial parasites and pathogens, through their effects on plant health and productivity, may impact negatively on plant invasiveness18.

Apart from the interactions of acacias with rhizobia and mycorrhiza, there is currently little knowledge about the identity of the overall soil microbial communities associated with acacia species. For instance, for A. dealbata only limited data are available from studies employing low resolution methods and/or low sample sizes19, 20 (but see ref. 7). In addition, most of these studies were carried out in soils in the proximity of plants, but not in the narrow zone of soil that surrounds and is most influenced by plant roots (i.e., the rhizosphere). As rhizosphere microbes can directly and/or indirectly affect the composition and biomass of plant communities21, increasing our knowledge on the root microbiome is important to better understand the factors contributing to plant invasiveness.

Here, we use Illumina MiSeq data (targeting 16S rRNA genes and ITS regions) and shotgun metagenomics to investigate microbial (bacterial and fungal) communities and functional processes associated with the roots of this species in various invasive populations of A. dealbata across South African grasslands, and compare them with those from the bulk soil. More specifically, we evaluate (i) how abiotic (i.e., soil chemistry) factors may shape the diversity and structure of these communities, (ii) identify prominent taxa that may contribute to the success of this invader and (iii) investigate whether rhizosphere and bulk soil microbial communities differ in their metabolic capacity.

Results and Discussion
Analysing the microbial communities associated with the rhizospheres of A. dealbata, we obtained 2,444,152 and 694,434 total high-quality reads, which resulted in 29,678 and 14,471 OTUs (97% cut-off) for bacteria and fungi, respectively. The majority of all prokaryotic OTUs in the rhizosphere were also present in the bulk soils (Supplementary Fig. S2a), whereas a larger proportion of the eukaryotic OTUs were unique to the sample type (Supplementary Fig. S2b). For both bacterial and fungal communities the OTUs shared between rhizosphere and bulk soil samples accounted for the majority of the reads (97.2% and 93% respectively; Supplementary Fig. S2a,b). The percentage of OTUs shared between all eight sampling sites was considerably smaller for fungal data sets than for the bacterial data sets (1.6% and 12%, respectively). This is in agreement with the view that fungal communities generally show more geographic structure than bacterial communities22.

OTU accumulation curves indicated reasonable sequence saturation at a regional level, especially for bacteria (Supplementary Fig. S3). The levels of microbial diversity (richness, Shannon, inverse Simpson, Pielou’s evenness) tended to be higher in the bulk soil than in the rhizosphere samples, although they did not differ significantly (Supplementary Fig. S4). This is in contrast to previous studies19, which showed A. dealbata-invaded zones containing higher bacterial richness and lower fungal richness compared to uninvaded zones. However, it is now accepted that the community fingerprinting method used in that study (i.e., DGGE) is not well suited to accurately estimate microbial richness23.

A total of 30 distinct bacterial phyla were detected across all samples. The most abundant sequences were affiliated with the phylum Proteobacteria (27% of total relative abundance), followed by Actinobacteria (23%), Acidobacteria (18%), Planctomycetes (8%) and Bacteroidetes (5%) (Fig. 1). These phyla have been shown to be widely represented in bulk and rhizosphere soil samples (e.g., see review by ref. 21), including those from other invasive species such as Japanese barberry24. At the class level, Actinobacteria (22%), Acidobacteria (17%), Alphaproteobacteria (17%), Planctomycetia (8%) and Betaproteobacteria (6%) were represented by the majority of sequences. Rhizosphere soil samples were enriched for Alphaproteobacteria (Kruskal-Wallis χ2 = 4.4; P < 0.05) and Gammaproteobacteria (Kruskal-Wallis χ2 = 7.4; P < 0.01), and depauperate in Spartobacteria (Verrucomicrobia; Kruskal-Wallis χ2 = 9.1; P < 0.01), compared with the bulk soil. Members of the Alphaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria are usually defined as copiotrophic25; that is, they compete successfully when organic resources are abundant. The high abundance of these OTUs in the rhizosphere of A. dealbata plants could reflect their ability to proliferate in the presence of plant-derived polysaccharides. Spartobacteria are highly abundant in grassland soils26, probably because they associate with nematodes, which are typically abundant in grasslands27. Whether the decrease in Spartobacteria in this study results directly from the effects of wattles or indirectly through trophic cascades needs to be further investigated.

More importantly, because Acacia contributed significantly to stand transpiration in the invaded stand in all seasons (between 27 and 42%; Figures 6B, 7), the competing P. pinaster trees experienced a clear water restriction, transpiring between 21 and 33% less water than P. pinaster growing in the non-invaded stand (Figures 6, 7).",High,"Comparing invaded and non-invaded regions clearly showed the difference in water and transpiration levels, where A. longifolia changed it.","Presence of A. longifolia altered the forest structure predominantly by increasing plant density in lower and mid-canopy.

VOCs emitted from A. longifolia led to a significant decrease in the length of stems and roots of treated seedlings (Figure 3). The reduction was generally found for all species; nevertheless, growth inhibition was more pronounced in S. alba and L. multiflorum. The production of root and stem biomass in all species included in the assay was also
significantly diminished.",Low,"Because the invasive plant was removed and isolated with native plants, the impact on natives was directly determined.

Acacia longifolia,Long-leaved wattle,Portugal,São Jacinto Dunes Nature Reserve (central-northern coast of Portugal),(1) Competition,MR - Major,"Results showed that native species richness was lower in both recently and long-invaded areas than
in uninvaded areas. As invasion time extended, species shared with native areas decreased,
reductions in plant cover, evenness and diversity intensified and species turnover rates declined.
Analyses of traits showed that: a) in both recently- and long-invaded areas geophytes,
hemicryptophytes and chamaephytes were underrepresented while species of therophytes adapted
to elevated nitrogen levels in the soil were overrepresented; b) in recently invaded areas, species
typical of dunes were replaced by native and exotic generalists; c) in long-invaded areas terophytes
and wind-dispersed species were underrepresented. Non-invaded areas had almost exclusively native species while several exotic species were present
in invaded areas (Figure 2.3).",High,"each type of stand (non-invaded, recently invaded and long-invaded), five permanent plots, each
10 x 10 m, were demarcated. Each plot was located at least 50 m from any of the others. Plots monitored for 5 years.","Regarding life forms (Figure 2.4), nanophanerophytes were the most abundant in non-invaded
areas, despite there being only five species, followed by chamaephytes (with more species evenly
distributed) and geophytes (with one species particularly abundant). Invaded-areas were dominated
by the (micro) phanerophyte A. longifolia, and the few species, very sparse, that were found under
A. longifolia were mainly therophytes. Three life forms, namely chamaephytes, geophytes and
hemicryptophytes, that were well-represented in native dunes were scarce, or even absent, in

Acacia longifolia,Long-leaved wattle,Portugal,São Jacinto Natural Reserve,(12) Indirect impacts through interaction with other species,MR - Major,"The analysis of the nifD and nodA genes provided conclusive evidence of the introduction of Australian strains and of the nodulation of native legumes by bacteria containing exotic genes. The dominance of these Australian symbiotic loci in the studied rhizobial community might be explained by the invasion of exotic bacteria or by lateral transfer of these symbiotic loci from introduced strains to the local bacteria. Australian bradyrhizobia might indeed nodulate the two native legumes as can be deduced from the strains that were common to the three host plants, but lateral transfer cannot be ruled out in this study. In any case, the final result is the invasion by exotic genes that disrupt the interaction between local plants and bradyrhizobia. Apart from the displacement of native vegetation and the increased inputs of organic matter and nitrogen in the invaded sand dune system (Marchante et al., 2008b), the above‐ground dominance of A. longifolia is mirrored below ground by the dominance of exotic bradyrhizobia and symbiotic loci that not only promote the growth of the exotic legume but also disrupt the native legume–rhizobia symbiosis. The limited number of nodA genes from this study in the European clade proves the over‐representation of Australian symbiotic genes in the bradyrhizobial community of the invaded area. The prevalence of Australian nifD and nodA genes among the bradyrhizobia obtained from the native legumes suggests that the exotic bacteria not only promote the growth of the invader (Rodríguez‐Echeverría et al., 2009) but can also strongly modify the native legume–rhizobia symbiosis. This disruption of native mutualisms and the facilitation of the invasive spread of the plant and bradyrhizobia by interaction between both groups of introduced organisms could constitute a process of invasional meltdown (Simberloff & Von Holle, 1999; Simberloff, 2006).",High,"Nodule collection (5–10 nodules per plant) was performed in five

enrichment by ca. 30% in plot 2. Similarly, δ15N of C. album became substantially enriched in the vicinity of A. longifolia, with background values of uninfluenced vegetation of ca. -11‰ (plot 1) and -8‰ (plot 2) increasing to values close to 0‰ (Fig 1D and 1E), even though C. album itself has no capacity of N2-fixation. In plot 3, which is not invaded by A. longifolia, N concentration was extremely low ( 7.3 g
Nkg-1). Heavily invaded plot only 17%. Three plots of 1,000 m2 area (20 x 50 m) were established in the dune system and subdivided
into 2 x 5 m subplots. In the three plots, C. album occurred frequently with even spatial coverage, allowing for a well-resolved spatial sampling design. Plot 1 and 2 each comprised stands of
the invasive A. longifolia, with 17% and 7% of the plot area covered by the invader, respectively. Additionally, a control plot (plot 3) of uninvaded native vegetation was established in April 2011. In the invaded final cluster three, all measured parameters were higher, indicating the paramount effects of the invasive species on N budget as well as on photosynthesis and water relations in the indicator species C. album (Figs 3 and 4). δ15N signatures approached the value of
atmospheric nitrogen (0‰), which, together with the marked increase in leaf N concentration,
suggests uptake and use of N by C. album that originated from symbiotic N2-fixiation. The increase in δ13C most likely is the result of two processes both reducing photosynthetic discrimination in C. album growing close to A. longifolia: on the one hand, better N
nutrition has been shown to increase photosynthetic capacity, leading to a decrease in ci/ca (the
ratio of internal to ambient CO2 partial pressure) and, accordingly, reducing photosynthetic
discrimination [54]. On the other hand, as A. longifolia is a strong competitor for water
[33,55], ci/ca could also be decreased due to reduced stomatal conductance in response to water
stress. Both effects lead to a higher foliar δ13C of C. album in the vicinity of A. longifolia and
indicate higher water use efficiency, but are not necessarily exclusively facilitative, as similarly
shown in [33] for a Pine stand invaded by A. longifolia.",Corema album,Higher N/C in native leaves but not said to be negatively impacting plant,"Hellmann C, Werner C, Oldeland J (2016) A spatially explicit dual-isotope approach to map regions of plant-plant interaction after exotic plant invasion.

Thermoregulatory efficiency (E) of L. wiegmannii was lower in modified sites (E=0.58) than in natural sites (E=0.70). This difference may be because this lizard occupied shaded microhabitats under acacias, with suboptimal thermal features. In contrast, L. multimaculatus in the modified habitat restricted its activity to open microenvironments that retained a similar structure to that of the native habitat, while maintaining high thermoregulatory efficiency in both habitat types (Emodified=0.92; Enatural=0.96). The environmental temperature in the habitat modified by Acacia introduction was slightly lower than in the natural habitat that resembles the original landscape. At sites where L. wiegmannii was captured, substrate temperatures were significantly lower in the modified habitat than in the natural one, whereas air temperature did not vary despite the modification. Microenvironmental temperatures (Ta and Ts) at L. multimaculatus capture sites were similar in modified and natural habitats. Habitats with a dense canopy produce thermal restrictions, since they reduce the areas for basking and limit the thermoregulatory opportunities for ectotherms (House and Spelleberg, 1983, Sartorius et al., 1999, Román et al., 2006). Apparently in the modified habitat because of restricted availability of thermally appropriate patches, L. wiegmannii individuals use microhabitats with lower microenvironmental temperatures (Ts). On the other hand, as a consequence of the advance of A. longifolia, the spatial distribution of L. multimaculatus was restricted almost exclusively to those patches that retained microenvironmental temperatures (Ts and Ta) similar to those of natural habitat, probably because this species is a microhabitat specialist.",Medium,"Dont know if native populations declined. captured 164 individuals of L. wiegmannii and 64 L. multimaculatus by hand or by noose between 0900 and 1800 h, corresponding to the entire daily activity period of this species (Vega 1999).

The microhabitats that each lizard species used as refuges differed between habitat types (Table 2). In both forested and nonforested habitats, L. wiegmannii sought
 refuge in native shrubs, subshrubs, and clump herbs more
 frequently than expected (>60% of the total observations;
 Fig. 2, Appendix). Refuges at the base of A. longifolia were also
 preferred by L. wiegmannii in forested habitats. In contrast, L.
 wiegmannii avoided bare sand and leaf litter as refuges in both
 habitat types (Fig. 2; Appendix). In forested habitats L.
 multimaculatus preferentially sought refuge under native
 subshnibs, A. longifolia, or buried in bare sand; they avoided
 clump herbs, erect-stem herbs, and leaf litter. In nonforested
 habitats L. multimaculatus preferred refuges under clump
 herbs but avoided bare sand, leaf litter, and sites under shrubs,
 subshnibs, or erect-stem herbs.  As predicted by the theoretical model of
 Ydenberg and Dill ( 1986), the habitat generalist L. wiegmannii
 behaves more cautiously when threatened by a potential
 predator in forested sites by increasing its FID by 26% with
 respect to nonforested sites. This increase in the FID may be
 explained by the fact that L. wiegmannii reduces its speed by 7% in substrates with an excess of leaf litter (e.g., forested habitat) compared to locomotory performance on bare sand
 substrates (C. Iribarren, personal observation).  Compared to nonforested habitats, the FID of L. multimaculatus decreased 29% in forested habitats, allowing a closer predator to approach before initiating escape.",Medium,"Used replicas: Predation pressure was evaluated by measuring the predation rate on plasticine replicas of lizards and the abundance of avian predators.

Both lizard species prefer refuges in native plants but, when they are scarce, the nonnative Acacia longifolia is selected as alternative refuge. In forested habitats, sand-burying behavior is a complementary strategy used by L. multimaculatus to avoid predation. The FID of L. wiegmannii was greater in forested habitats than in nonforested ones. In contrast, L. multimaculatus exhibited a short FID in forested habitats, mostly because sand-burying behavior appears to reduce the risks typically associated with exposed areas. Plasticity in antipredatory behavior suggests that these lizards could recognize predators and develop a suitable antipredatory behavior. We conclude that increased predation pressure and structural alterations of the habitat in the presence of nonnative A. longifolia affect the decisions that determine how, when, and where these lizards flee.

Despite high N content and low lignin/N and C/N ratios, almost 43% of the A. longifolia litter is recalcitrant/very slowly decomposed, accumulating on soil surface for long periods. The slow decomposition rate of A. longifolia litter together with the production of much more litter than the native vegetation (ca. 3 times more than C. salviifolius) is reflected in the accumulation of a thick N-rich litter layer on soil surface of invaded areas. This promotes a continuous input of C and nutrients to the soil, and leaves a hidden legacy long after the removal of the invader that, amongst other impacts, prevents the regeneration of native species.

There are several factors that can be attributed to the decline in species diversity, particularly competition for resources.",Low,Small scale study. Diversity indices gave different results.,"At dense canopies, there is strong competition for light. In the present study, it is evident that in heavily invaded plots, wattle tree stands shaded the native grass species resulting in lowered species richness and diversity. Unpalatable species such as Eragrostis plana and E. curvula were dominant across all treatments, thus lowering the grazing capacity in the study area. These species are unfavourable in a rangeland system.

Seedlings of the exotic Acada auriculiformis and the native Schima superba were transplanted into each community. Leaf area index, litter stock, soil moisture and soil fertility were higher in the Acada plantation and secondary forest than in the degraded hilly land. However, light transmission was much greater in the degraded hilly land than in the other two communities. Survival and growth of A. auriculiformis were greatest in the degraded hilly land but survival and growth of 5. superba were greatest in the Acada plantation. Growth responses of the transplanted seedlings were related to soil water content and light transmission rate. To accelerate the vegetation restoration of the islands, the existing secondary forest should be protected and the plantations should be improved by introducing native tree seedlings. As a possible two-stage restoration scheme, Acada could be planted in degraded hilly land to serve as nurse plant for S. superba.",Low,"Only one species looked at, studied survival after transplantation into different communities.",NA,Schima superba,Native comunity not studied,"Li, P., Huang, Z.L., Xiang, Y.C. and Ren, H., 2011.

Acacia auriculiformis,NA,Brazil,Espı´rito Santo and Bahia,(1) Competition,MO - Moderate,"With respect to the hypotheses described at the beginning of this study, we found that (1) Acacia has a negative effect on woody species composition, causing death of plants, and on increment in total height and total basal area of the invaded Mussununga; (2) disturbance and land-use change affect diversity and structure of the vegetation; and (3) the ground layer community was not affected by Acacia, while biological invasion seems to be the main driver in the woody layer. [...] The negative relation of A. mangium and A. auriculiformis on the woody layer community in Mussununga is in agreement with other studies that evaluated different species of acacias (e.g., Costello et al. 2000; Marchante et al. 2003; Rascher et al. 2011) and corroborates that Acacia dominance is a key factor in the destruction of the Mussununga ecosystem (Meira-Neto et al. 2017). The effect of Acacia invasion on the woody community suggests a replacement of species, caused mainly by Acacia and the death of native woody plants (see Fig. 1). That is a concern since the plant species in Mussununga are adapted to very specific environmental conditions with a combination of flooding and drought and nutrient-poor sandy soil (Meira-Neto et al. 2005; Saporetti-Junior et al. 2012; Gastauer et al. 2017). However, the positive relationship of the basal area of Acacia with abundance and basal area of native woody species challenges our previous expectations. Although the process of (re-)cover after disturbance is a parsimonious interpretation (see below ‘‘Threats to the Mussununga ecosystem’’; Fig. 4), Acacia acts as nurse plant in the early invasion stage in the Mussununga ecosystem, as supported by the higher native species richness in Acacia-focused plots than noninvaded ones (Meira-Neto et al. 2017). When at low density, Acacia possibly can benefit native species by ameliorating the stressed conditions in Mussununga, providing shade and increasing soil nitrogen and carbon contents (Marchante et al. 2009; Hellmann et al. 2011; Meira-Neto et al. 2017), thereby, facilitating the establishment of plants not adapted to stress conditions. For instance, Yang et al. (2009) found better physiological status and lower stress in shaded plants under A. mangium and A. auriculiformis canopies in China. We hypothesize that the positive effect of nitrogen addition and shading in the Mussununga should only occur up to a threshold of Acacia abundance. After becoming dominant, Acacia would outcompete the light-demanding species (Meira-Neto et al. 2017) and possibly favor their own seedlings (Rascher et al. 2011). This point of view is corroborated here by the positive relationship of the basal area of Acacia on the woody layer community and, contrarily, the statistical effect of the abundance of Acacia on the proportion of dead plants (Fig. 2d, e, f) and by the fact that the negative effects of invasion of Acacia species frequently take decades to appear (Koutika and Richardson 2019). The increase of biomass promoted by Acacia measured by total basal area and the total geometric mean of height (that is, including Acacia in the measurement) indicates a change in the vegetation structure of the Mussununga. Therefore, the gradient of vegetation types from grassland to woodland, limited by flooding, nutrient content in soil, and fire (Saporetti-Junior et al. 2012; Gastauer et al. 2017), is unbalanced by Acacia occurrence. Despite the negative effect on the native woody community, following Acacia invasion, the sandy-savanna Mussununga tends to become taller and more closed with consequent reduction of light availability and increase of nitrogen content. This trend is clearly related to the capacity of the Acacia species studied here to grow faster and taller than native plants from Mussununga, and even in the early stages of invasion this can already be detected using aerial images (Lehmann et al. 2017). Under this new environmental condition, the typical light-demanding species of Mussununga could be replaced by shade-tolerant ones or, in worse scenarios, by Acacia itself becoming a monodominant forest.",Low,"Many plots studied, which could lead to higher confidence, but no distinction made between two acacia spp. .

If trees  with  holes were present  in  territories  (even one or two  trees), Magpie  Robins built  significantly more  nests  in these  trees  than  in  Coconut  trees,  which  were  abundant (mean use:  93% v 7% [n  =  161; x 2 ]   =  12.3, P  < 0.001). Because rotten  tree  holes were  scarce, birds  had to fly  long distances  between the nest  site and feeding areas, which in itself  contributed to  nest  failure. Sometimes when Magpie Robins were nesting in Coconut 
trees,  a n   Indian  Mynah  pair  started  nesting  in  the  same tree.  The  mynahs  were  not  seen  to  interfere  directly with the Magpie Robin nest, but their close proximity was enough to disturb the Magpie Robins. Immediately after the mynahs arrived, the nest-building  female robin  abandoned her nest and started  a  new nest  somewhere else (n = 9). If mynahs arrived during incubation, the female robin left the nest. The percentage  of incubation  ( + 9 5 %   c.1.)  by the  female  disturbed  by  mynahs  was  significantly lower than that by  the same female without disturbance (1% [c.i. 0.0-2.2%]  v  49% [33.9-64.5%];  n= 4, Wilcoxon test:  z =  1 . 8 3 ,   P  < 0.04).

",Canberra,(1) Competition,MO - Moderate,"There is widespread concern over the impact of introduced species on biodiversity, but the magnitude of these impacts can be variable. Understanding the impact of an introduced species is essential for effective management. However, empirical evidence of the impact of an introduced species can be difficult to obtain, especially when the impact is through competition. Change in species abundance is often slow and gradual, coinciding with environmental change. As a result, negative impacts on native species through competition are poorly documented. An example of the difficulties associated with obtaining empirical evidence of impact due to competition comes from work on the Common Myna (Acridotheres tristis).

Observations of isolated acts of competition or predation do not validate any general conclusions about the impact of the myna on a variety of species.

",Canberra,(1) Competition,MO - Moderate,"Through the establishment of 225 nest boxes, we examined the relationship between tree density and the abundance and nesting success of three bird species in Canberra, Australia. The common myna (Acridotheres tristis) is an introduced species in Australia, and the crimson rosella (Platycercus elegans) and eastern rosella (Platycercus eximius) are native species. We then investigated the impact of common myna nest box occupation on crimson rosella and eastern rosella abundance. Tree density significantly influenced the abundance and cavity-nesting of all three species. Common myna abundance (birds per square kilometer) was greatest at low tree density sites (101.9 ± 22.4) and declined at medium (45.4 ± 10.1) and high (9.7 ± 3.6) tree density sites. The opposite pattern was observed for the crimson rosella, with greater abundance (birds per square kilometer) at high tree density sites (83.9 ± 9.3), declining over medium (61.6 ± 6.4) and low (31.4 ± 3.9) tree density sites. The eastern rosella was more abundant at medium tree density sites (48.6 ± 8.0 birds per square kilometer). Despite the strong influence of tree density, we found a significant negative relationship between common myna nest box occupancy and the abundance of the crimson rosella (F 1,13 = 7.548, P = 0.017) and eastern rosella (F 1,13 = 9.672, P < 0.001) at some sites. We also observed a slight increase in rosella nesting interruptions by the common myna at lower tree densities (high: 1.3% ± 1.3, medium: 6.6% ± 2.2, low: 12.7% ± 6.2), although this increase was not statistically significant (F 2,40 = 2.435, P = 0.100). Our study provides the strongest evidence to date for the negative impact of the common myna on native bird abundance through cavity-nesting competition. However, due to the strong influence of habitat on species abundance and nesting, it is essential to investigate the impacts of introduced species in conjunction with habitat variation.

The higher number of encounters and interactions between Indian Mynah and Tahiti Flycatcher around nests containing eggs and chicks strongly suggests the existence of nest predation by Indian Mynah, whereas the more uniform presence of Red-vented Bulbul, during and outside reproductive activity suggests the existence of an inter-specific competition for nest sites and territories, rather than direct nest predation.",Low,"Whilst there is some observational evidence, it is difficult to establish the extent and severity of competition impacts.",NA,Pomarea nigra,NA,"Blanvillain, C., Salducci, J.M., Tutururai, G., and Maeura, M.

It is important to note that their study was conducted in wild foraging situations, with no artificial manipulation of food resources, thus demonstrating that Common Mynas do not show high levels of aggression even during food scarcity, as would be likely in a natural foraging situation. Our study also found that, across species, there was a trend towards higher frequencies of initiated aggression being associated with lower frequencies of being the recipient of an aggressive act, a relationship that has been demonstrated in other studies. Importantly, the behaviour of Common Mynas did not obviously deviate from this trend. Theories of high aggression would predict Common Mynas to fall well above the trendline, indicating a tendency to be involved in disproportionately high levels of interspecific aggression relative to other species. In fact, Common Mynas fell just below the trendline (in both the breeding season and non-breeding season), providing no evidence that they either initiate or elicit aggression more than the other species observed.",High,There is observational evidence to support the assessment.,NA,"Cracticus tibicen, Manorina

Nest-box use was dominated by the common brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula), the common ringtail possum (Pseudocheirus peregrinus) and the common myna (Acridotheres tristis), an aggressive introduced bird.

Common mynas dominated nest-box use during spring/summer, potentially reducing the availability of this resource to indigenous species. We found evidence that the probability of a nest box being occupied by either species of possum was greater in remnants with abundant possum populations. Brushtail possums preferred thick-walled pine nest boxes over thin-walled plywood nest boxes, most likely owing to differences in their thermal insulation properties.

The presence of dogs and cats was not related to the total abundance of birds overall or small birds in gardens. While garden characteristics may influence the presence of small birds to some degree, the presence of noisy miners, a species that are thought to aggressively exclude other species from their territories, is likely to be an important influence on these species in suburban areas.

Three major factors shaped the interaction network: breeding timing, nesting preferences and the ability to excavate or widen the cavities, which were found to be a limited resource. Cavity enlargement by the early- breeding invasive rose-ringed parakeet may enhance breeding of the invasive common myna in previously unavailable holes. The myna excludes the smaller invasive vinous-breasted starling, a direct competitor of the primary nest excavator, the native Syrian woodpecker. Therefore, management and eradication efforts directed towards the common myna alone may actually release the vinous-breasted starling from competitive exclusion by the common myna, increasing the negative impact of the vinous-breasted starling on the native community. As found here, interactions among multiple alien species can be crucial in shaping invasion success and should be carefully considered when aiming to effectively manage biological invasions.

Myna density varied 5.7-fold among the five urban habitat types surveyed, but differed significantly only between streetscapes and open parkland and wooded parkland and open parkland. Mynas mainly foraged on the ground on grass and sealed surfaces; foraging behaviour was dominated by gleaning (7O% of records) and varied as a function of the substrate occupied by the bird and on which the food resource occurred, but not of habitat. The diet comprised insects, seeds, fruit and human food-refuse, but insects and/or seeds predominated. Mynas engaged in interspecific aggression infrequently (0.8 encounters observation). Most interactions were with native honeyeaters and the exotic Common Starling Stumus vulgaris, but they usually only resulted in displacement of either combatant by a few metres.

Over the last few years, Mynas have begun to invade the breeding range of the hollow-nesting (and Vulnerable) Superb Parrot in NSW to the north of the ACT (Murrumbateman, Yass). Over the past few years, Mynas have come to be recognized and strongly disliked by a growing part of the Australian community (even though others, oblivious to their identity or otherwise, continue to feed them, advertently or inadvertently). Mynas were recently ranked by respondents to the ABC’s Wildwatch Survey as the “Most Significant Pest” in Australia (ABC 2004). Much of this (sometimes violent) dislike of Mynas is generated by people who have observed Mynas harassing native wildlife, especially birds in nesting hollows. There is also concern, especially in areas where Mynas are at high densities, of risk to human and livestock health from fouling. The propensity of Mynas to steal food from domestic animals and from humans at outdoor eating areas means that there is a high likelihood of pathogen transmission – if infective birds, livestock, or people come into juxtaposition. Possible risks to human and livestock health from Mynas, although poorly quantified, should not be taken lightly, as recent experience of zoonosis transmission (eg, SARS, bird flu, West Nile Virus) suggests (Daszak et al 2000).

(sovereign state)",Ascension Island,(2) Predation,MO - Moderate,"Mynas and Ascension Frigatebirds were the only avian species seen foraging in the Sooty Tern colonies. Frigatebirds were only observed depredating chicks while Mynas were only recorded as scavenging, consuming, puncturing eggs and harassing adult terns causing them to desert their eggs. Mynas consumed and punctured eggs that were attended by adult Sooty Terns. Mynas were also seen scavenging on the carcasses of dead adult terns presumably for insects. We found no evidence to suggest that Mynas killed tern chicks. Depredation from Mynas was not random. Egg sets were either heavily depredated or, more often, not depredated at all. We monitored 1238 eggs (935 on the periphery and 303 in the core), during 10 Sooty Tern breeding seasons. Of these 88 (7.1 %) eggs failed as a result of Mynas consuming or puncturing them during 6.5 days of monitoring. Of the 935 eggs (6065 egg days) monitored that were situated within 7 m of the perimeter of the colonies, 87 eggs were consumed or punctured by Mynas. In summary, of all Sooty Tern eggs lost to Mynas, 21 % wereconsumed, 39 % punctured and 40 % deserted. Using Eq. 5 to derive annual rate of egg depredation due toMynas (AEDEP.), and assuming Mynas could access all part of the two colonies equally, we calculated that the annual number of Sooty Tern eggs depredated varied between 4968 and 62,226 (mean: 32,965 ± 20,355 eggs, n = 10 field seasons). The number of eggs depredated on the periphery of the colony where Mynas were known to depredate eggs varied between 3974 and 49,781 (mean: 26,372 ± 16,284 eggs, n = 10 field seasons).",High,There is observational evidence to support the assessment.,NA,Onychoprion fuscatus,NA,"Hughes, B.

(sovereign state)",Ascension Island,(2) Predation,MO - Moderate,"Despite the presence of invasive black rats (Rattus rattus), common mynas (Acridotheres tristis), and feral domestic cats (Felis catus), sooty terns (Onychoprion fuscatus) breed in large numbers on Ascension Island in the tropical South Atlantic Ocean. These introduced predators impact the terns by destroying eggs or interrupting incubation (mynas), eating eggs (mynas and rats), eating chicks (rats and cats), or eating adults (cats). Between 1990 and 2015, 26 censuses of sooty terns and five of mynas were completed and myna predation was monitored on 10 occasions. Rat relative abundance indices were determined through trapping around the tern colonies and rat predation was monitored by counting chick carcasses. Cat predation was quantified by recording freshly killed terns. Prior to their eradication in 2003, cats had the greatest impact on sooty terns and were depredating 5,800 adults and 3,600 near-fledging chicks (equivalent to the loss of 71,000 eggs) each breeding season. We estimated that 26,000 sooty tern eggs (13% of all those laid) were depredated by approximately 1,000 mynas. Rats were not known to depredate sooty terns prior to cat eradication but in 2005, 131 of 596 ringed (monitored) chicks (22%) were depredated by rats. In 2009 chick carcass density was 0.16 per m2. Predation by rats hugely increased in the absence of cats and was the equivalent of 69,000 eggs. Care is needed when applying our findings to seabirds globally.

",Tahiti,(2) Predation,MO - Moderate,"In 1998, only 25 Tahiti Flycatchers (Pomarea nigra), a forest bird endemic to Tahiti (French Polynesia) remained. A recovery programme, aimed at nest protection through both rodent control and tree banding, was initiated. At this time it was supposed that the species was mainly the victim of island infestation by ship rats (Rattus rattus). In the 3 years of this study 54 nests were found and 17 fledged young produced, of which 12 survived the early stage of fledging. Despite an excellent 1999 breeding season and efficient nest protection against rodents, only five of 19 nests produced fledged young in 2000. This was related to higher (P=0.002 and 0.015 respectively) Indian Mynah (Acridotheres tristis) encounters and aggressive interactions in 2000 and 1998 than in 1999. Indian Mynah encounters and interactions were also higher during reproductive activities (and particularly at incubation and nestling stages) in comparison with the non breeding period (P <0.001). In contrast, Red-vented Bulbul (Pycnonotus cafer) encounters and interactions were more uniform throughout. Significantly more Indian Mynah and Red-vented Bulbul were observed in flycatcher territories which experienced nest failure or early fledgling death in comparison with those which experienced reproductive success (P=0.003 and 0.002 respectively). This strongly suggests that these two introduced species represent an important threat to the Tahiti Flycatcher’s survival. Currently, young birds (less than 4 years old) represent 42% of the population, an increase from 12% at the start of the recovery programme. The higher number of encounters and interactions between Indian Mynah and Tahiti Flycatcher around nests containing eggs and chicks strongly suggests the existence of nest predation by Indian Mynah, whereas the more uniform presence of Red-vented Bulbul, during and outside reproductive activity suggests the existence of an interspecific competition for nest sites and territories, rather than direct nest predation.",Low,"Whilst there is some observational evidence, it is difficult to establish the extent and severity of predation impacts.

Acridotheres tristis,Common myna,U.S.A.,Kauai Island,(2) Predation,MO - Moderate,"We studied the breeding biology of Wedge-tailed Shearwaters (Puffinus pacificus) at a colony of about 700 pairs on the north shore of Kauai Island, Hawaii, between 1978 and 1981. Most birds nested in earthen burrows, but they also readily used artificial ones. The nesting chronology at the study area was similar among years and nearly identical to that recorded elsewhere in Hawaii. Shearwaters began to arrive in March, and spent considerable time rehabilitating burrows before laying eggs synchronously in June. Most eggs hatched between 1 and 12 August. Chicks fledged more than 100 days later during November. Approximately 80% of the eggs produced fledglings in 1978 and 1979, but success dropped in 1980 and 198 1, probably because of predation and human disturbance.
Most of the loss of potential production at Kilauea Point involved egg mortality, since over 85% of the eggs that hatched in natural and artificial burrows produced fledglings, except in 1980 (Table 4). The major cause of egg mortality differed among years. In 1978, nearly all of it was due to predation by the Common Myna. During the 1981 breeding season, a barrierfence was built around the visitor-use area during mid- to late incubation, and the shearwaters were disturbed less, at least late in the season. Nevertheless, predation by Common Mynas was as severe in 198 1 as it had been in 1978> probably because it was impossible to repel these birds (Byrd and Moriarty 1980) at the proper time. Chick mortality resulted from several factors. A few chicks died of unknown causes within one week after hatching. However, the major cause of mortality among older chicks was the destruction of burrows, owing to either human intrusion in the colony (1980) or heavy rainfall (other years ofour study). Several chicks were buried by mud after burrows collapsed, but more commonly death resulted from predation by owls (Byrd and Telfer 1980), exposure to high temperatures, or starvation after chicks wandered away from burrow sites and adults failed to find them. Similar consequences of heavy rainfall have been reported at a shearwater colony on Manana Island, Hawaii (Whittow 1979). Dogs and cats were significant predators at Kilauea Point (Titcomb 1960) until control measures were instituted there in 1975. They are still serious predators in shearwater colonies elsewhere on Kauai where such protection is lacking (Byrd and Boynton 1979).",Low,"Whilst there is some observational evidence, it is difficult to establish the extent and severity of predation impacts.

Myna density varied 5.7-fold among the five urban habitat types surveyed, but differed significantly only between streetscapes and open parkland and wooded parkland and open parkland. Mynas mainly foraged on the ground on grass and sealed surfaces; foraging behaviour was dominated by gleaning (7O% of records) and varied as a function of the substrate occupied by the bird and on which the food resource occurred, but not of habitat. The diet comprised insects, seeds, fruit and human food-refuse, but insects and/or seeds predominated. Mynas engaged in interspecific aggression infrequently (0.8 encounters observation). Most interactions were with native honeyeaters and the exotic Common Starling Stumus vulgaris, but they usually only resulted in displacement of either combatant by a few metres.

Acridotheres tristis,Common myna,Republic of Seychelles,Bird Island,(2) Predation,MN - Minor,"Recent studies of nesting seabirds on Bird Island, Seychelles, have demonstrated the capacity for Common Mynas Acridotheres tristis to inflict high predation on eggs when combined with other factors, especially human disturbance. Observed effects of mynas on seabirds on Bird Island: During the Sooty Tern breeding season, from May to October, Feare (1976a) reported mynas taking unguarded eggs from around the colony’s periphery but concluded that they had no significant impact on the population. When Sooty Terns are absent from the island, mynas regularly feed in the deserted nesting area, mainly on insects.While catching incubating ground-nesting adult Brown Noddies for ringing and other studies in 2013 and 2014, CL & MD discovered that while adults were being processed, mynas rapidly approached the unguarded nests and took the eggs. Eggs were sometimes taken less than one minute after the breeding adult was captured and the egg was left unguarded. Of the 31 nests on the ground that were monitored for the purpose of the ringing study, egg predation by mynas was observed in three cases. Four other eggs were lost the day after the noddies were processed, potentially also resulting from myna predation, although we cannot exclude the possibility that other potential predators, Common Moorhens Gallinula chloropus or land crabs, could have been involved. After CL & MD realised that such rapid and frequent myna predation was occurring, all eggs of birds caught for processing were temporarily covered with a cloth, which was flying back to their nests (usually within five minutes). This simple protection method was successful as none of the eggs in the remaining nests that we monitored was predated within the 24 hours after the birds were captured. At the approach of humans, nesting Lesser Noddies become agitated and highly vocal, and in 2011–14 CJF & CSL noticed that such agitation and calling was also stimulated by the arrival of a pair of mynas in a nesting tree (Fig. 2). Closer observation revealed that pairs of mynas climbed among the branches, sometimes leading a Lesser Noddy to leave its nest in an attempt to deter the myna, but the unattended egg was quickly taken. The members of the pair appeared to be working together, one creating a distraction that permitted the other to take the egg. Disturbance by humans, including unwitting tourists when taking photographs, could leave eggs open to predation when mynas are present.",Low,"Whilst there is some observational evidence, it is difficult to establish the extent and severity of predation impacts.

",Canberra,(2) Predation,MN - Minor,"In Australia, the common myna, Acridotheres tristis, is a feral bird that reduces biodiversity through predation and aggressive competition with native wildlife, particularly hollow-nesting birds and mammals. Mynas also reduce public amenity through noise at communal roosts, and fouling, with attendant risk for human and domestic animal health. Canberra was myna-free until 1968, when about 100 birds were released, mostly in Forrest. Mynas now occupy all Canberra suburbs; in many areas there are more than 100 birds to the square kilometre. Numbers still appear to be rising, with escalating spillover effects into adjoining lands, much of which is anthropogenically modified woodland, the myna’s preferred habitat. Many nature reserves have been invaded by mynas. Feral myna populations are similarly expanding in most parts of eastern Australia and many other parts of the world, notably the Pacific islands, where several endemic birds have become seriously threatened as a consequence. In 2000, the Common Myna became the most common feral bird in Canberra and the World Conservation Union (IUCN) declared A. tristis among “100 of the World’s Worst Invasive Species”.",Low,There is no observational evidence to support the assessment.,NA,NA,NA,"Tidemann, C.R.

Although the young birds from Nest One fledged successfully from the nest, it was apparent that management and future reduction of the introduced Common Myna (Acridotheres tristis) would be necessary in order to establish the Kura as a self-sustaining native species on Atiu. The ultimate success of the program will be measured by how well the new population of Kura can maintain and sustain itself on Atiu without the assistance of the human community. It may be that the flock will always require some intervention in the form of nest protection, especially from Common Mynas.

So far, documentation of nest predation by these two species is restricted to a very few cases. This is confirmed by our experiments with artificial nests in which no egg predation by bulbuls was documented. Although red-vented bulbuls and Indian mynas were common in these forests they were never observed preying upon nests. Our behavioural data showed that frequent fights occur between the larger red-vented bulbul and the Tahiti monarch during the breeding period. The causes that trigger these fights remain obscure and the consequences of this energy investment on monarch reproductive success is unknown. However, the present decline of the relict monarch population that survived in the 1970s in the highland forest on Tahiti coincided with its colonization by the red-vented bulbul (Thibault et al., 1999) suggesting a possible negative impact of bulbuls on the small monarch population already weakened by black rats.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Thibault, J.

Myna density varied 5.7-fold among the five urban habitat types surveyed, but differed significantly only between streetscapes and open parkland and wooded parkland and open parkland. Mynas mainly foraged on the ground on grass and sealed surfaces; foraging behaviour was dominated by gleaning (7O% of records) and varied as a function of the substrate occupied by the bird and on which the food resource occurred, but not of habitat. The diet comprised insects, seeds, fruit and human food-refuse, but insects and/or seeds predominated. Mynas engaged in interspecific aggression infrequently (0.8 encounters observation). Most interactions were with native honeyeaters and the exotic Common Starling Stumus vulgaris, but they usually only resulted in displacement of either combatant by a few metres. In urban Melbourne in the breeding season, Common Mynas were thus habitat generalists, but specialized in ground feeding, mainly on insects and/or seeds and primarily by gleaning.

Acridotheres burmannicus,Burmese myna,Israel,Tel Aviv,(1) Competition,MN - Minor,"We studied the nesting cavities in the largest urban park in Israel over two breeding seasons. We found evidence for a complex interaction network that includes negative, neutral and positive interactions, but no synergistic positive interactions among aliens. In two of these cavities the Burmese mynareplaced the Syrian woodpecker within less than a week from the interaction day. The interactions between the Burmese myna and the Syrian woodpecker and between the Burmese myna and the common myna were especially aggressive and included much physical contact between the interacting birds. The Burmese myna replaced nesting Syrian woodpeckers twice before the latter completed their breeding cycle, and replaced the locally rare scops owl once. Burmese mynas showed strong competition with the native woodpeckers over cavities. Contrary to the common mynas, the smaller Burmese myna shares similar cavity preferences with the woodpeckers and can occupy woodpecker nest without any modification of cavity size and type. They also strongly prefer to nest in intact woodpeckers cavities. Indeed, we found that Burmese mynas and woodpeckers interacted aggressively around most of the active woodpecker cavities observed, and we recorded two aggressive nesting woodpecker replacements by the Burmese myna during the woodpeckers’ breeding cycle. Thus, these species show contramensalism (±). The native Syrian woodpecker, which excavated majority of cavities used for breeding in the park, clearly facilitates the establishment of the Burmese myna. This suggests that the Burmese mynas may pose the largest threat to the native cavity engineers, since they are small enough (Feare and Craig 1999; Cramp and Perrins 1994) to enter the cavity and their nesting period overlaps with the woodpeckers’ nesting season. Our results indicate that the control of the Burmese myna may be the most beneficial management action for the native cavity nesters in the Yarkon Park, as it may lead to competitive release of the woodpeckers from the alien invasive myna and may improve the breeding situation for the native great tits, the house sparrows and for the scops owls.",Low,"Whilst there is some observational evidence, it is difficult to establish the extent and severity of competition impacts.

Alectoris chukar,Chukar,Greece,NA,(3) Hybridisation,MN - Minor,"The nominal subspecies of rock partridge (Alectoris graeca graeca) is widely distributed in Greece, where populations are declining due to over-hunting and habitat changes. Captive-reared chukars (A. chukar) have been massively released throughout the country, raising fear that introgressive hybridisation might have disrupted local adaptations leading to further population declines. In this study we used mtDNA control-region sequences and Bayesian admixture analyses of multilocus genotypes determined at eight microsatellite loci, to assess the extent of introgressive hybridisation in 319 wild rock partridges collected in Greece. A neighbour-joining tree split the mtDNA haplotypes into three strongly supported clades, corresponding to rock, red-legged (A.␣rufa) and chukar partridges. We did not detect any case of maternal introgression. In contrast, admixture analyses of microsatellite genotypes identified from four to 28 putative hybrids (according to different assignment criteria), corresponding to 1.2–8.8% of the samples, which were widespread throughout all the country. Power and limits of admixture analyses were assessed using simulated hybrid genotypes, which revealed that a small number of markers can detect all first and second generation hybrids (F 1 and F 2), and up to 90% of the first generation backrossess. Thus, the true proportion of recently introgressed rock partridges in Greece might be ca. 20%.

Microsatellites provided evidence for the genetic isolation of the FT mountain population, whose low level of hybridization with A. chukar had been unveiled in a former paper.

",Elba,(3) Hybridisation,DD - Data deficient,"The ever-increasing biotic homogenization - especially when associated with introgressive hybridization - raises concern for the reduction of the spatial component of diversity in wildlife worldwide. Nonetheless, there is a growing attention to the potential conservation value of hybridization in fastening the adaptive evolutionary responses to rapidly changing selective pressures. Under these premises, we investigated the genetic affinity of the red-legged partridge (Alectoris rufa) population inhabiting Elba Island (Italy) in the context of the overall species phylogeography and particularly of the nominate subspecies it is traditionally ascribed to. Although notoriously hybrid with the congeneric A. chukar, this island population is of undisputedly value because of its long natural history and self-sustainability. As such, its adaptive conservation management calls for a comprehensive knowledge including the assessment of its geographic origin. For this purpose, 110 fecal samples were collected across Elba, genotyped at their joint Cytochrome-b and Control Region genes (2,249 characters), and compared with 149 conspecifics from all over the species distribution range. We confirmed a widespread A. chukar mitochondrial DNA introgression in Elba partridges, whereas their expected formal assignment to the nominate subspecies from Italy and France was rejected, since these turned out to be closely related to conspecifics from the Iberian Peninsula. This counterintuitive result found support in a large variety of literary sources and compelling evidences from personal testimonies revealing recent intense management with farm-reared birds of Spanish origin. Although the nativeness of Elba partridges was disproved, we advise local authorities to keep warranting the ongoing conservation efforts - and especially restore the connectivity between the western and eastern island sub-populations - as this resource may still be conceived as the ultimate repository for part of the otherwise extinct Italian A. r. rufa genome. Indeed, the admixture with conspecifics from the Iberian Peninsula does not necessarily mean that the entirety of the native nuclear genome of Elba partridges has been wiped out. Furthermore, these latter represent an interesting case study in conservation biology to investigate the possible role played by introgressive hybridization in the adaptation to recent land use and vegetation cover changes associated with rural abandonment in an insular yet heavily anthropized context.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Forcina, G., Guerrini, M., Barbanera, F.

species were rare. They were Acridotheres albocinctus, Acridotheres ginginianus, Sturnus burmannicus,
Sturnus contra, Aplonis panayensis and Gracula religiosa. Even so, the results of this study may at least
demonstrate that some of the exotic starlings and mynas are fairly common and widely distributed in Taiwan. This raises a question what is the impacts of these exotic birds on the environments, particularly the native birds. In

Aratinga nenday,Nanday Parakeet,United States of America,Florida,(1) Competition,DD - Data deficient,"We aimed to determine the species identity, nest site requirements, relative nest abundance, geographic distribution, and interactions of parrots with native cavity-nesting bird species. Not all parrots reported or observed in our study area were actively breeding. Some parrots were observed at tree cavities, which previous studies have suggested is evidence of reproduction, but our inspections with an elevated video inspection system suggest they never initiated nesting attempts. Several parrot species did successfully nest in tree cavities, Red-masked Parakeets (Psittacara erythrogenys) and Orange-winged Parrots (Amazona amazonica) being the most common (n = 7 and 6 nests, respectively). The Nanday Parakeet is known to be a more common breeding resident farther north along the southeast coast of  Florida, and in the Tampa Bay region (Pranty and Lovell 2011). We incidentally noticed a pair of Nanday Parakeets using a Pileated Woodpecker cavity in a utility pole in Bradenton during our study period and  included the observation in our study. We were successfully able to inspect one Nanday Parakeet nest in a royal  palm at Hugh Taylor Birch State Park in Fort Lauderdale.Ten years prior to this inspection, Pranty and Lovell (2011) reported a nesting attempt of Nanday Parakeets at the same park, in a palm tree. The main breeding population of this species appears to have shifted from Broward to Palm Beach County. At the time of that report, only one of 12  Nanday Parakeet nesting attempts in south-east Florida occurred in Palm Beach County. During the 2 years  of our study, 73.5% of Nanday Parakeet observations in southeast Florida were in Palm Beach County. The Nanday Parakeet is the most widespread cavity-nesting parrot in Florida, observed in over one quarter of Florida’s counties.

Circus approximans,Swamp Harrier,French Polynesia,Mo’orea,(2) Predation,MN - Minor,"This study examines one of the invasive predators on Mo’orea by observing swamp harrier (Circus approximans) habitat preference and behavior to determine if it has changed in comparison to its source population.
A total of 20 kill sites and 45 animal waste samples were collected and analyzed. All samples contained bird remains. Seven samples were the remains of intoduced Passeriformes while 58 of the samples were the remains of native Procellaridae (Tahiti petrel (Pseudobulweria rostrata) and Audobon’s shearwater (Puffinus lherminieri)). Of the animal waste samples 7 (16%) samples were swamp harrier pellets while 38 (84%) were feral cats. 

The cat scat samples were much more prominent (84% of samples) than swamp harrier pellets (16% of samples), and are therefore the major predator of seabirds on Mo’orea. This does not account for possible swamp harrier kills that are regurgitated at other locations such as roosting sites (Redpath et al 2001), which could not be examined. Seabird populations in the presence of swamp harriers are known to be able to succeed (Powlesland et al 2002) while some believe that seabird populations cannot succeed in the presence of feral cats (Bonnaud et al 2007). Both introduced species have adapted some of their strategies in order to be successful on Mo’orea. The swamp harriers changed where they nest, and are expanding their traditional hunting range to include the forest and cliff areas. The feral cats on the island have moved away from rural lands into the higher elevations to capture seabirds. As a result it appears the native bird populations are being adversely affected.

Pigeons are suspected of transmitting the avian pathogen, Trichomonas gallinae, to the Galápagos dove (Zenaida galpagoensis)(Harmon et al., 1987), an endemic species with several threatened populations (Phillips et al., in press). Of primary concern is the potential transmission of avian malaria by pigeons to the native avifauna now that the mosquito vector (Culex quinquefasciatus) is established in Galápagos (Peck et al., 1998; Gottdenker et al., 2005). Although pigeons have not been linked to the decline or extinction of native species in the Galápagos the risk exists and the po- tential consequences are substantial. Applying the ‘‘precautionary principle’’ (Rogers et al., 1997; Clergeau et al., 2004), the Charles Darwin Research Station (CDRS), in cooperation with the GNPS ini- tiated a campaign to eradicate pigeons from the archipelago in 2000.

As  each pair of Tropicbirds generally lays only one egg each season, this can have as serious impact on the breeding success over large areas of Bermuda’s coastline (although established pairs can sometimes produce a second egg after a recovery period). One of the objectives of this study has been to compare the breeding success of Tropicbirds nesting in artificial nests installed at the study locations, compared to that of birds nesting in natural rock cavities. The breeding success of the artificial nests appears to be markedly higher than that of natural nest sites, most likely because they can often be installed in ideal locations high enough on cliff edges to be out of reach of inundation by hurricane waves.

Japanese quails have been reproduced in captivity for centuries and domesticated. Massive releasing of Japanese domesticated quails, or hybrids, in west European countries might threaten with hybridization the gene pool of wild quail populations. Here, we used mitochondrial (mtDNA) and nuclear DNA markers (microsatellites), and Bayesian admixture analyses aiming to assess subspecies distinction and identify hybrids in wild and captive-reared quails. A phylogenetic tree identified two major mtDNA clades, corresponding to the two subspecies, and allowed detecting 12 hybrids in wild common quails sampled in Spain. Additional hybrids were identified in wild quails sampled in Spain, Italy and Senegal using microsatellite markers. Wild quails sampled in Mongolia showed japonica mtDNAs, but their microsatellite genotypes were admixed, suggesting that common and Japanese quails can hybridize in nature.

This appears to be the case for common quail (Coturnix coturnix) in France where wild populations artificially come into contact with domesticated Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica) raised for meat and egg production but sometimes released for hunting purposes. In order to highlight the possible existence of gene flows between both taxa, a comparison of nuclear (25 microsatellite loci) and mitochondrial (sequencing and RFLP) DNA polymorphisms was performed on 375 com-mon quails (from France, Spain and Morocco) and 140 Japanese quails (from France and Japan). Genetic diversity was assessed, and analyses (Factorial Correspondence Analysis, Bayesian admixture) of molecular polymor- phisms revealed clear differentiation between the two taxa, making it possible to detect for hybrids among quails sampled in the wild. Eight birds expected to be common quail were found to be two pure Japanese quail, one probable backcross to C. japonica, three F1/F2 hybrids, and two probable backcrosses to Coturnix coturnix. These results show that Japanese quails were released and suggest that the two taxa hybridize in the wild. They confirm the urgent need for preventing the release of pure Japanese or hybrid quails to preserve the genetic integrity of C. coturnix.

Several laboratory studies suggest that this could lead to a decline in the impulse to migrate in the common quail, and a drop in the frequency of phenotypes showing this tendency. This could lead to an increase in common quail populations in North Africa and a decrease in Europe. This paper provides new data on the proportion of hybrids in Catalonia (Northeast Spain) over 24 years (1983–2006) showing howrestocking with Japanese quail or hybrids affects native populations of common quail. The first hybrids were detected in 1990 with an estimate of 4.65% of non-native individuals during the breeding season of wild common quail populations. No increase in non-native or hybrid numbers was detected during the study period, indicating that restocking poses no serious conservation problems at present. However, this may change in the near future, either with or without changes in the current scenario. A prudent policy with regard to restocking with non-native individuals is suggested.

Coturnix japonica,Japanese Quail,Italian Republic,Sicily,(3) Hybridisation,DD - Data deficient,"Farm-reared quails are released to the wild in Europe in vast numbers every year to increase hunting bag quotas. Experimental studies indicate that rather than the native common quail (Coturnix coturnix), the restocking is often done with domestic Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica) or with hybrids of domestic Japanese quail and common quail. Such practices are thought to be a severe threat for the native species as it could lead to introgression of domestic Japanese quail alleles into the wild common quail genome and potentially alter the migratory and reproductive behaviour in wild populations. In this study, we assessed the genetic purity of a captive population of common quail that was established from wild-caught founders caught on the Southern Italian coast in Sicily (Italy). We evaluated the proportion of ancestry to common and Japanese quail in this captive population via genetic screening using nuclear microsatellite markers and mitochondrial DNA analyses. We showed that the captive farm quail in our study had no sign of admixture with domestic Japanese quail and had similar genotype frequencies relative to wild common quail, confirming the success of the breeding programme for the native species.

The present study examined spatial and temporal variations in black swan grazing activity in a large temperate estuary to estimate potential site-specific and estuary-wide impacts on seagrass biomass. We monitored diel swan grazing activities, their seasonal abundance, estimated the rate at which swans consumed seagrass and measured changes in the standing stock of seagrass biomass at four sites in Tauranga Harbour. Black swans foraged primarily at high tide (both during the day and night) and were more numerous at sites with larger meadows, particularly during autumn. Grazing created circular devegetated patches (average size ∼0.28 m2) with 92% of shoots, 25% of roots and 99% of rhizomes removed. We measured an average seagrass consumption rate of 394 g dry mass (DM) swan−1 d−1 in line with consumption rates of other Zostera-feeding waterfowl. At sites where grazing was most intense (annual removal of 19–20% of the average seagrass biomass), we observed a substantial decline (43–69%) in plant biomass in the subsequent growing season.

The potential role of black swans (Cygnus atratus Latham) in stabilising the phytoplankton dominated state by grazing on macrophytes was investigated during a period of increase and decline in the benthic vegetation (Nitella) in 1993-94. The swan population density was closely  correlated with plant biomass (r 2 = 0.95). Although the swan population became as high as 25 ha t direct grazing consumption was slight. The grazing rate was 0.007 day-1, by comparison with plant growth rates of 0.06--0.10  day-1, and loss rates in periods of decline of 0.07-0.18 day - i .

Plant biomass normally increased  when the benthic photon irradiance exceeded 7% of that at the surface, and decreased when it was lower than that.  We conclude that lack of light was far more important than swan grazing for plant decline. When light or other conditions for macrophyte growth are marginal, the cumulative effect of waterfowl grazing consumption might well  be critical, however, for keeping macrophyte biomass below the threshold for macrophyte dominance, in spite of the  consumption being small.

Cygnus olor,Mute Swan,U.S.A.,Chesapeake Bay,(8) Grazing/herbivory/browsing,MO - Moderate,"Mute swans (Cygnus olor) are poorly studied despite their potential to impact submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV). We measured vegetation characteristics (i.e., percent cover, shoot density, and canopy ht) of SAV beds in controls (unfenced), 2-year exclosures, and 1-year exclosures at 18 sites in the Chesapeake Bay, Maryland, USA, to quantify the impact of herbivory by mute swans on SAV during 2003 and 2004. Mute swan herbivory had a substantial adverse impact on percent cover, shoot density, and canopy height of SAV. At the end of the study mean percent cover, shoot density, and canopy height in the controls were lower by 79%, 76%, and 40%, respectively, as compared to those in 2-year exclosures. During 2004, percent cover, shoot density, and canopy height increased by 26%, 15%, and 22%, respectively, between early and late seasons of SAV growth in exclosures, but they decreased by 36%, 41%, and 18%, respectively, in the controls. Paired mute swans predominantly occupied 6 of 7 moderate-depth sites (0.76-0.99 m), and these sites experienced less (i.e., 32-75%) SAV reduction. All (n = 7) shallow water sites (0.50-0.75 m) were predominantly occupied by mute swan flocks, and percent cover reduction of SAV was as high as 75-100% at these sites. Mute swan flocks also predominantly occupied 3 of the 5 deep-water sites (>1 m) and 1 of 7 moderate-depth sites, wherein we recorded considerable (i.e., 77-93%) SAV reduction.

Dicrurus macrocercus,Black drongo,U.S.A. (sovereign state)  Mariana Islands,Rota,(2) Predation,DD - Data deficient,"Several agents, particularly disease and introduced predators, have been implicated in causing population collapses of birds on Pacific islands (van Riper III et al. 1986, Savidge 1987). However, no evidence links disease to bird declines on Guam in the Mariana Islands (Savidge 1986). Predation by the introduced brown tree snake (Boigu irregularis), responsible for the extinction of forest birds on Guam (Savidge 1987), also appears unrelated to the Rota Bridled White-eye decline because the snakes are unknown on Rota. Instead, the predatory Black Drongo (Dicrurus macrocercus), introduced on Rota in 1935 (Baker 195 l), is implicated in causing the population declines of several native bird species. Black Drongos did not become abundant until the 1960s (E. Taisacan, pers. obs.), the
time when the decline in Rota Bridled White-eye populations was first noted. Maben (1982) demonstrated that introduced Black Drongos on Guam preyed on small passerines, although she believed drongos had little effect on their populations. Despite this belief, the present distribution of Black Drongos on Rota shows a negative relationship with that of white-eyes, which are now found mostly in extensive stands of native Sabana forest. Engbring et al. (1986) found Drongos abundant in lowlands (4042 bird/l0 stations), and particularly in open habitat, but uncommon in the forest of the Sabana plateau (15 birds/l0 stations). The Rota Bridled White-eye appears particularly susceptable to predation by Black Drongos because it is very small and feeds in exposed microhabitats. Like the Saipan subspecies, it is a flocking, vocal bird that forages in the forest canopy and flies above the forest (see Craig 1989, 1990). Notably, all birds on Rota too large for drongo predation are abundant and widespread (Engbring et al. 1986). Only the small Rufous Fantail (Rhipiduru rufifroons) is also uncommon.",Low,The evidence for population declines is somewhat speculative.

The only exception is the black drongo, which occurs only on Rota and Guam and has been observed harassing and depredating native birds (Maben 1982, Amidon 2000).

Dicrurus macrocercus,Black drongo,U.S.A. (sovereign state)  Mariana Islands,Rota,(2) Predation,MN - Minor,"Craig and Taisacan (1994) suggested that black drongos were responsible for the decline and range restriction of the Rota BWE based on correlations between the increasing abundance of drongos on the Sabana and the decline of Rota BWEs. They reported that survey data by Engbring et al. (1986) showed that the density of potential black drongo prey species, like the Rota BWE and rufous fantail, were lower in areas with high black drongo densities. They also reported, based on personal observations, that black drongos became more abundant in the 1960s when the decline of Rota BWEs was first noted. However, no data are available to confirm this and the reason for the apparent increase in black drongo numbers is unknown. Black drongo and Rota bridled white-eye relationships were addressed using current and historical survey data. Black drongos were found to prey on Rota bridled white-eyes but they probably only played at most a partial role in the decline of the Rota bridled white-eye. On 18 August 1998 we observed a black drongo eating a Rota BWE in an Elaeocarpus joga tree in study plot 2HA. No other observations of attempted or successful predation of drongos on Rota BWEs were observed. Our results indicate that black drongos do prey on Rota BWEs, black drongo numbers are lower on the Sabana than other regions of the island as reported by Craig and Taisacan (1994), and that black drongo numbers have increased on the Sabana from 1982 to 1994 while Rota BWEs numbers have decreased. However, we detected no negative relationship between black drongo numbers and any of the small native passerines, including Rota BWEs, that drongo predation could impact. Therefore, we are still uncertain what role black drongos played in the decline and range restriction of the Rota BWE. We believe that the habitat alteration discussed earlier may have played the major role in the decline by reducing the availability of preferred Rota BWE habitat.

Estrilda astrild,Common waxbill,Portugal,NA,(1) Competition,MC - Minimal concern,"One of the simplest ways invasive species can impact native communities is by competing for resources, for example food or nesting sites. During Spring and Summer in Iberia, waxbills forage mostly on grasses while native granivorous birds forage mostly on forbs, and waxbills use more agricultural areas compared to native birds (Sullivan et al. 2015), suggesting that waxbills use a differentiated food niche relative to those of native birds. Further evidence comes from comparing food preferences of waxbills and European serins (Serinus serinus) foraging on the same mosaic of agricultural fields (Cardoso et al., submitted). The European serin is the most likely competitor for food with waxbills, because it is the smallest native granivorous passerine in Iberia, it is very abundant and also forages in the low vegetation of open habitats (Clement et al. 1993). The plant species foraged upon by waxbills and serins during autumn differed substantially (probability of a feeding event by waxbills and serins coinciding on the same plant species was only 20%; Cardoso et al., submitted). In winter, when energetic stress is larger and food availability lower, and when, if food were limiting, we would expect greater similarity in the plants used by serins and waxbill, their diet similarity did not increase. On the contrary, both bird species fed on a more varied set of plants during winter and decreased their diet similarity (Cardoso et al. submitted). Thus, even comparing waxbills with its most similar native species in terms of foraging behaviour and foraging habitat, diets appear well differentiated. Interestingly, the differences in food use between waxbills and serins were in part because both birds, but especially waxbills, included seeds of non-native plants in their diet. Without the contribution of exotic plants, the diet similarity between serins and waxbills in autumn would be three times as high (Cardoso et al. submitted).  A possible concern is that the waxbill is the ecological nearest-neighbour of the reed bunting (Emberiza schoeniclus), sharing some habitat and nesting preferences (Batalha et al. 2013), and the subspecies of reed bunting breeding in Iberia (E. s. lusitanica and E. s. witherbyi) are endangered and have fragmented distributions (Kvist et al. 2011). The ecological evidence reviewed here suggests that waxbills should not pose a significant threat.

This paper addresses the question of whether a reintroduced population of a critically endangered island endemic, the Mauritius fody (Foudia rubra) is competing or co-existing with an exotic congener, the Madagascar fody (F. madagascariensis). We investigated habitat use and feeding ecology of the Mauritius fody during two early phases of its reintroduction onto a restored islet, and compared these parameters with the sympatric population of Madagascar fodies. The number of Mauritius fody territories increased from 4 to 20 in a seven month period following release, and overall mean territory area (c. 1 ha) was significantly larger than that of the more abundant Madagascar fody (c. 0.07 ha). The initial four territories were located in mature coastal forest, whilst those of the Madagascar fody were characterised by open canopy, smaller trees and grass-dominated ground cover. Mauritius fodies foraged mainly in dead leaves for insects, whilst the Madagascar fody fed primarily on the seeds of a native grass species. Mauritius fody territories later expanded to include a range of habitats. Differing ecological requirements indicate that divergence between these congeners may be sufficient for them to coexist and exploit contrasting resources on restored islets. We discuss the implications of these findings for both the long-term restoration of the Mauritius fody and other avian recovery programmes and highlight the critical importance of long-term post-release monitoring to assess the success of reintroduction to offshore islets as a long-term conservation strategy.",Low,"Whilst there is some observational evidence, it is difficult to establish the extent and severity of competition impacts.",NA,Foudia rubra,NA,"Garrett, L. et al.

Gallirallus australis,Weka,New Zealand,Macquarie  Island,(2) Predation,MV - Massive,The extinction of the Macquarie Island parakeet (Cyanoramphus erythrotis) coincided with a sudden large increase in the numbers of cats and wekas apparently caused by the introduction of rabbits. It is suggested that the introduction of rabbits upset the previously stable mixture. They rapidly multiplied and spread providing an abundant and year round food supply for cats. This may have eased cat predation on wekas and young rabbits may have provied more food for the wekas. The cats and wekas increased immediately putting more pressure on parakeets throughout the year. This increased predation may have been sufficient to reduce parakeets from abundance to extinction in just over ten years and may also have destroyed the indigenous banded rail (Gallirallus philippensis macquariensis) which was extinct by 1984.,Low,"Whilst the evidence for impact is observational, it is difficult to establish the extent and severity of predation impacts on the Macquarie  Island parakeet.

Gallirallus australis,Weka,New Zealand,Macquarie  Island,(2) Predation,MR - Major,"In the late 1800s Blue Petrels were described as “exceedingly numerous” on the lower coastal slopes 
of Macquarie Island  (Campbell, 1901). By the 1970s they had been extirpated and survived only on  
offshore rock stacks (Brothers, 1984). Superficially they are similar to Antarctic Prions, breeding in  
small burrows during the summer months (Bonadonna and Mardon, 2010 ). So why did prions persist  
while Blue Petrels perished? In part, it appears to be because Blue Petrels are present for more  
months in the year reoccupying burrows at the end of the breeding season, and in part because   
they are restricted at high latitudes to low elevations. While there were undoubtedly impacts from rats and cats,  Wekas Galliralus australis, in particular, are implicated in the complete removal of formerly abundant small petrels  from coastal slopes of Macquarie (Brothers and Skira, 1984). Wekas avoided cat predation by occupying dense tussock grasslands around  the  coast, rarely occurring on the exposed plateau where vegetation is low and sparse. They damaged breeding burrows and predated eggs and chicks (Falla, 1937). The low elevation Blue Petrels  succumbed, whereas Antarctic Prions survived in higher elevation refugial habitat on the plateau away from Wekas.  Species declines in the presence of Wekas and cats, and their survival or extinction were governed by body size, breeding phenology, and the width of their realized niche on the island.  
We completed whole island surveys two established species that remained extant in the presence 
of invasive predators, Antarctic Prions Pachyptila desolata and White-headed Petrels Pterodroma

Backyard chickens were more frequently diseased than broilers, and were more likely to be seropositive for several pathogens (Mycoplasma gallisepticum, infectious laryngotracheitis virus, infectious bronchitis virus, avian reovirus, and Marek's disease virus). Seroprevalence for other pathogens (avian paramyxovirus-1, infectious bursal disease, avian encephalomyelitis virus, and avian adenovirus) was relatively high among all chickens. Preliminary serological results from wild birds revealed no evidence of previous exposure to these diseases, which suggests that transmission of disease from poultry to wildlife is currently not detectable with the sample sizes and tests employed, and that wildlife are likely not the source of exposure to poultry. Our results suggest that backyard chickens may pose a greater threat to Galápagos avifauna because they are more likely to be infectious, have a high seroprevalence for numerous pathogens, and interact directly with wild birds or wild bird habitat, with no biosecurity measures employed.",Low,"Whilst there is some observational evidence, it is difficult to establish the extent and severity of transmission of diseases to native species  impacts.",NA,NA,NA,"Soos C, Padilla L, Iglesias A, Gottdenker N, Bedon MC, Rios A and Parker PG (2008) Comparison of pathogens in broiler and backyard chickens on the Galapagos Islands: implications for transmission to

Pathogens identified in domestic chicken populations of immediate avian conservation concern are Newcastle disease, Mycoplasma gallisepticum, and the proventricular parasite Dispharynx sp. Newcastle disease (avian paramyxovirus-1) poses an imminent threat to Galápagos penguins (Spheniscus mendiculus), flightless cormorants (Phalacrocorax harrisi), and lava gulls (Larus fuliginosus), species with very small population sizes (less than 1500 animals each). Additionally, litter from broiler farms could affect ecological processes in local ecosystems.

Gallus varius,Green Junglefowl,Territory of Cocos (Keeling) Islands,Southern Atoll,(1) Competition,MR - Major,"Two species of introduced chicken occur on the Southern Atoll. The Red Junglefowl occurs on virtually all islands and is kept domestically, both free ranging and enclosed by residents. It is less common on West Island where the Green Junglefowl was introduced and has successfully established a large population. Junglefowls and the CBBR are ecologically very similar, particularly in their ground-foraging habit, dietary catholicism, food items, and manner of feeding. Combined with habitat modifications and the loss of seabirds from the Southern Atoll islands, the ecosystem may not be able to accommodate two species sharing similar niches, with the larger junglefowls likely to be the more successful competitor. The eradication of feral chickens would be required before any reintroduction of CBBR. The last definite Southern Atoll record of CBBR was a specimen killed by a cat on West Island in 1991. Despite some sightings on West Island in the early 2000s, none of which can be fully substantiated, recent surveys (2005) have confirmed the likely local extinction of CBBR from the Southern Atoll. Habitat modification, predation by cats, rats and humans, and competition with jungle fowls (and potentially rats) have probably all contributed to this extirpation.

Garrulax canorus,Chinese hwamei,U.S.A.,Hawaii,(1) Competition,MN - Minor,"The object of this study was to determine whether interspecific competition modified local geographic distribution, after taking into account the effect of habitat structure. The tendencies for 14 passerine birds to have positive or negative associations were examined, using 7861 sample points in seven native forests on the islands of Hawaii, Maui, and Kauai. All birds were at least partly insectivorous and were fairly common in forested areas, although some fed chiefly on nectar or fruit. Species-pairs were classified as primary or secondary potential competitors based on general dietary similarity. To evaluate the association between species and to account for the effect of individual species' habitat preferences, partial correlations were computed for each species-pair in a study area from the simple correlations between the species and 26 habitat variables plus two quadratic terms to represent nonlinearity. The partial correlations represented a short-term (""instantaneous"") assessment of the strength of competitive interactions, and did not reflect the accumulation of competitive displacement through time. Of 170 partial correlations in the analysis, only 10 indicated significant negative association. The general pattern was of positive association (76 significantly positive partials), which probably resulted from flocking and from attraction of birds to areas of resource superabundance. Two species-pairs showed consistent patterns of negative partial correlations over several adjacent study areas, the Japanese White-eye/Iiwi in montane Hawaii, and the Japanese White-eye/Elepaio in windward Hawaii; both patterns could be reasonably attributed to direct competition. Species-pairs were grouped by the native or exotic status of the component species. Native/exotic pairs had a significantly greater proportion of negative partial correlations (37%) than either native/ native pairs (8%) or exotic/exotic pairs (0%). This pattern was consistent across the seven study areas and appeared to reflect the occurrence of interspecific competition along a broad and diffuse ecological ""front"" between a co-evolved native avifauna and recently introduced exotic species. The role of competition in the pattern was corroborated by the significantly higher proportion of negative partial correlations among species-pairs of primary potential competitors than among those of secondary potential competitors. Our results suggested that t47% of the primary potential competitors among native/exotic species-pairs may experience at least small depressions in local population density due to competition. Although the negative correlations were for the most part small (average negative r = 0.06), one species could eventually replace another as spatial displacement accumulated through time. The Japanese White-eye appeared to have a principal role in native/exotic interactions, with 62% of the partial correlations between it and native primary potential competitor species being negative. Noteworthy implications were that (1) it was important to account for the habitat responses of individual species when studying the role of interspecific competition in modifying small-scale geographic distribution; (2) competition was frequently sporadic in its geographic occurrence and in the species affected, thus supporting Wiens' (1977) theory of competition; and (3) as a consequence, the role of interspecific competition in modifying distribution may be difficult to detect statistically with small data sets.",Low,"Whilst there is some observational evidence, it is difficult to establish the extent and severity of competition impacts.",NA,"Myadestes obscurus, Drepanis coccinea, Palmeria dolez, Himatione sanguinea, Loxops coccineus, Paroreomyza montana, Oreomystis bairdi, Hemignathus parvus, Hemignathus virens, Chasiempis sandwichensis",NA,"Mountainspring, S. & Scott, J.M., (1985).

Garrulax canorus,Chinese hwamei,Republic of China,NA,(3) Hybridisation,MN - Minor,"Identification of interspecific hybrids is often a subject of primary concern in the development of conservation strategies. Here we performed a genetic analysis combining mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), microsatellites and single nucleotide polymorphic sites (SNPs) to assay the level of hybridization and introgression between an introduced babbler, Chinese hwamei Leucodioptron canorus, and its close relative, the endemic Taiwan hwamei L. taewanus in Taiwan. Fifty- five Chinese hwameis from the Asian mainland and 69 Taiwan hwameis, including nine morphological hybrids, were sampled and analyzed. Evidences of mitochondrial introgression were found in three hybrids and one Taiwan hwamei. Five unlinked interspecific SNPs were identified at nine anonymous nuclear loci with interspecific differentiation (total Fst00.77) that was much higher than that at seven highly polymorphic microsatellite loci combined (total Fst00.1). Bayesian cluster analysis based on five interspecific SNP loci and two highly differentiated microsatellite loci (Fst?0.08) suggested that twelve individuals sampled in Taiwan were likely F2 or backcross hybrids, among which eight were morphological intermediates. A total of 20.3% (14/69) individuals sampled in Taiwan were suggested to be hybrids, suggesting that fitness reduction in hybrids might be negligible. These results imply that without an effective management strategy, the entire Taiwan hwamei population could easily become an admixed with Chinese hwamei and loose its evolutionary integrity. To reduce introgressive hybridization, illegal trade of Chinese hwamei should be strictly regulated and only the expensive male Chinese hwameis should be legally imported to minimize the chance for Chinese hwameis being released into the field. In our study we also found interspecific SNP markers to outperform microsatellite loci in detecting hybridization and introgression between two closely related species, which may be ascribed to the lower level of homoplasy of SNP loci.",Low,"Whilst there is some observational evidence, it is difficult to establish the extent and severity of hybridization impacts.",NA,NA,NA,"Li, S.

Introduced birds may not only aid invasions of exotic plants but also may be the sole dispersers of native plants. The most common species are also frugivores, particularly the Japanese White-eye (Zosterops japonicus) and Red-billed Leiothrix (Leiothrix lutea), but there are also Japanese Bush-Warblers (Cettia diphone), Hwamei (Garrulax canorus), Northern Cardinals (Cardinalis cardinalis), Spotted Doves (Streptopelia chinensis), and Common Mynas (Acridotheres tristis). We assessed seed dispersal at the ecotone between native- and exotic-dominated forests and quantified bird diets, seed rain from defecated seeds, and plant distributions. Introduced birds were the primary dispersers of native seeds into exotic-dominated forests, whichmay have enabled six native understory plant species to become reestablished. Some native plant species are nowas common in exotic forest understory as they are in native forest. Introduced birds also dispersed seeds of two exotic plants into native forest, but dispersal was localized or establishment minimal. Seed rain of bird- dispersed seeds was extensive in both forests, totaling 724 seeds of 9 native species and 2 exotics with over 85% of the seeds coming from native plants.Without suitable native dispersers, most common understory plants in Hawaiian rainforests nowdepend on introduced birds for dispersal, and these introduced species may actually facilitate perpetuation, and perhaps in some cases restoration, of native forests. We emphasize, however, that restoration of native forests by seed dispersal from introduced birds, as seen in this study, depends on the existence of native forests to provide a source of seeds and protection from the effects of ungulates. Our results further suggest that aggressive con.trol of patches of non-native plants within otherwise native-dominated forests may be an important and effective conservation strategy",Low,There is no observational evidence to support the assessment.,NA,NA,NA,"Foster, J.

Gymnorhina tibicen,Australian magpie,New Zealand,NA,(1) Competition,MO - Moderate,"We used five-minute bird counts to investigate whether introduced Australian magpies (Gymnorhina tibicen) influence the abundance of other birds in rural New Zealand. Over 3 years, magpies were removed from five c. 900-ha study blocks. Pre-treatment counts occurred between November 1999 and January 2000, and post-treatment counts in the same months for the following three years. In our research, counts of both kererū and tūī more than doubled on average in magpie treatment blocks compared with nontreatment blocks, although there was considerable variation between study blocks (Tables 2 & 4; Fig. 2). Kererū and tūī are both frequently reported to be attacked by magpies despite being uncommon now in most rural areas (Morgan et al. 2005). Tūī feed mainly on nectar and fruit, and kererū on fruit and leaves, in both native forests and exotic gardens. Both species are known to move many kilometres to seasonal food sources, including across pasture in fragmented landscapes. Neither species forages commonly on pasture on the New Zealand mainland, and it is unclear why magpies attack such apparently harmless species. We suggest introduced mammals preying on nests in native forests are primarily likely to limit tūī and kererū numbers in the wider landscape (Innes et al. 2004, 2005), but magpies may block access to key, perhaps seasonal, resources for these birds at particular sites.

Magpies are also very infrequent predators at bird nests in rural New Zealand compared with ship rats (Rattus rattus), harriers and cats (Felis catus). If nest predation and contact attacks by magpies on other species are rare, the cost of magpie aggression for other pasture-feeding species is either disturbance (involving movements of birds for short distances) or exclusion from preferred feeding areas.",Low,"Whilst the evidence for impact is empirical, it is difficult to establish the extent and severity of competiton impacts to populations of kererū and tūī species in New Zealand.

Accordingly, most rural birds, including all birds that were seen attacked by Magpies in the current study, could compete with Magpies for food. Competition for resources often causes agonistic behaviour between species, with the highest rates of aggression being between species with the most resource overlap. Instead, the species that were counted in the highest numbers close to Magpies were usually the most often attacked, and attacks were more
frequent during observations when more birds were counted. Magpies may consider other birds as potential food competitors but are willing to tolerate them in low frequencies within their territory because the energy obtained from the amount of food removed by birds in low density is less than the energy required to chase them away. However, when the numbers of birds counted close to groups increased, the amount of food being removed from the territory may have exceeded the energy required to conduct an attack.",Low,"Whilst the evidence for impact is empirical, it is difficult to establish the extent and severity of competiton impacts to populations of Kingfishers and Spur-winged Plovers  in New Zealand.",NA,"Halcyon sancta, Vanellus miles",NA,"Morgan, D., Waas, J.R. & Innes, J., 2006.

where high resource availability exists (e.g. bush remnants or private gardens containing nectar- or fruit-bearing plants). These habitats should attract the greatest number of native birds during times when plants are in bloom or producing fruit (spring to early summer). We predicted that if magpies do have a local-scale impact on the distribution of native birds, visitation rates by native birds during peaks in food availability should be higher at sites where magpies have been removed (quantified by measuring abundance).

Three count methods were used toestimate bird abundance: five-minute bird counts and ‘slow-walk’ transects in bush remnants, and five-minutebird counts and ‘snapshot’ counts in gardens. Generally, the abundance of native birds did not increase intreatment areas after magpie removal. In bush remnants, transect counts were typically better at detecting thepresence of most species compared with five-minute bird counts. In gardens, snapshot counts were better at detecting tui (Prosthemadera novaeseelandiae) while five-minute bird counts were better at detecting magpies.

Gymnorhina tibicen,Australian magpie,New Zealand,NA,(2) Predation,MN - Minor,"Magpies were reported attacking 45 bird species, although one (harrier hawk) was attacked considerably more often than any other. The list of attacked species is virtually a complete list of New Zealand’s rural birds. Magpies were observed preying on eggs on five occasions (8% of kill attacks; Fig. 8). Only a small proportion of attacks where victims were killed (17%) resulted in consumption of adult or young birds by magpies. Most birds that died as a result of being attacked (75%) were subsequently abandoned by the magpie.

Several  non-exclusive  hypotheses  about  why magpies attack birds and other objects can be explored using the results of this analysis: Magpies are themselves predators which kill and eat other birds. This is generally untrue.  Although magpies occasionally ate small birds, most attacks occurred against birds and mammals which were far too large for them to eat, and two-thirds of adult birds killed by magpies were not eaten; even most young birds that  were killed were not eaten (Fig. 8). Magpies did not even come into contact with the birds they chased in about half of the reported attacks (Table 1, Fig. 5), so predation was an unlikely intention.",Low,"The evidence for impact is anecdotall, it is difficult to establish the extent and severity of predation impacts to populations of rural bird species in New Zealand.

Harriers were reported  to  be  attacked  nearly  three  times  as often as the next most reported species (blackbird 
(Turdus merula) and song thrush (T. philomelos)), perhaps because they are large and conspicuous and would easily be seen from large distances or moving vehicles.  Birds more likely to be reported may include easily recognised or highly valued species.  People may be more inclined to report attacks on uncommon native birds such as kereru (Hemiphaga novaeseelandiae) and tui (Prosthemadera novaseelandiae) because they care for these species and hope that their report  will  trigger some conservation action.

Leiothrix lutea,Red-billed Leiothrix,Japan,Kyushu,(1) Competition,MN - Minor,"In deciduous broad-leaved forests in Japan, the Red-billed Leiothrix forages in the lower layer of the forest and nests in thickets of dwarf bamboo. Only one sympatric species, the Japanese Bush Warbler Cettia diphone, nests in the same habitat where competition between them is likely. We discuss the possible impact of the Red-billed Leiothrix on native species with reference to the utilisation of nesting habitat: 

In the Japanese Bush Warbler, only one nest was successful from 18 nests (5.3%) in 1997, and no nest was successful in both 1998 (from 33 nests) and 1999 (from 14 nests). Most failures after clutch initiation were due to total loss of clutches or broods, which suggests nest predation. We observed the Jay Garrulus
glandarius and snakes (species unknown) predating nestlings.

The locations of nests in the bamboo thicket differ between the Red-billed Leiothrix and Japanese Bush Warbler.
Even in the case where nests of these species were close to each other, direct interaction suggesting in-
terspecific territoriality was not observed. It is unlikely that competition for nest-sites occurs between these species. However, indirect interference competition is probable. When we searched for nests of the Red-billed Leiothrix, nests of the Japanese Bush Warbler were also found. A high density of nests may attract various kinds of predators into the breeding areas. In this study, the density of Red-billed Leiothrix nests, which was two to three times higher than that of Japanese Bush Warblers, may have caused an increase in the number of predators and predation on nests. The breeding success of Japanese Bush Warbler may be low due to indirect interference competition caused by the increase of Red-billed Leiothrix.",Low,There is not enough evidence to be certain if the decline in reproductive success of the Japanese Bush-warbler is caused by the Red-billed Leiothrix through apparent competition.,NA,Cettia diphone,NA,"Amano, H.

Leiothrix lutea,Red-billed Leiothrix,U.S.A.,Hawaii,(1) Competition,MN - Minor,"The object of this study was to determine whether interspecific competition modified local geographic distribution, after taking into account the effect of habitat structure. The tendencies for 14 passerine birds to have positive or negative associations were examined, using 7861 sample points in seven native forests on the islands of Hawaii, Maui, and Kauai To evaluate the association between species and to account for the effect of individual species' habitat preferences, partial correlations were computed for each species-pair in a study area from the simple correlations between the species and 26 habitat variables plus two quadratic terms to represent nonlinearity. 

Native/exotic pairs had a significantly greater proportion of negative partial correlations (37%) than either native/
native pairs (8%) or exotic/exotic pairs (0%). Analysis of interspecific association among Hawaiian forest birds shows fairly consistent trends across seven forested study areas. By partialing out the effect of habitat, the number of significant negative correlations between the 170 species-pairs (counting each forest occurrence as independent) is significantly reduced from 37 prehabitat to 10 posthabitat correlations (X2 = 20.8, P < 10-5, df= 1)... If one did not account for habitat preferences, these correlations would be evidence for interspecific competition among pairs where dietary overlap is substantial, e.g., between the Melodious Laughing-thrush and the Red-billed Leiothrix. The Red-billed Leiothrix/Amakihi pair accounts for the remaining negative correlation.  

Here the results dramatically show virtually no competitive interaction among native or among exotic
species; instead, there is a broad and diffuse ""front"" of competition occurring between the native and exotic
avifaunas. The role of competition is further indicated by the greater proportion of negative posthabitat cor-
relations among primary potential competitors than among secondary potential competitors. We would
characterize the relationships between native and exotic species as a combination of direct and diffuse
competition, affecting about one-half (47% in Table 12) of the primary potential competitors among native/exotic species in a forest.

Leiothrix lutea,Red-billed Leiothrix,Japan,Kyushu,(1) Competition,DD - Data deficient,"In Kyushu, southwestern Japan, the introduced population of the Red-billed Leiothrix Leiothrix lutea has increased rapidly and its range expanded considerably since early 1980s. In order to clarify the influences of Red-billed Leiothrix on native bird species, we examined the similarities and differences in foraging patterns among species occurring in a deciduous broadleaved forest on the Ebino Plateau, during the breeding seasons from 1997 to 2000. Leiothrix foraged in a lower vegetational layer with bamboo, intermediate in height between the foraging levels of the Japanese Bush Warbler Cettia diphone and various Parus species. Foraging height, extent of foraging on deciduous trees and foraging technique were major factors best distinguishing Leiothrix from native species. Segregation of foraging niche was distinct and no apparent niche shift, due to invasion of the new species, was detected. Aerial insects tended to be more abundant just above bamboo, mainly about one meter above the canopy, than above bare ground. Thus, jumping, a specific technique used by Leiothrix, is effective for capturing aerial in- sects or agile invertebrates resting on leaves and twigs. Aerial insects were found to be abundant in the foraging space preferred by Leiothrix. Gleaning and hanging, tech- niques mainly used by native species, are suitable for capturing prey of low mobility such as Lepidoptera larvae. Probably due to morphological constraints, Parus spp. and Japanese Bush Warblers seldom foraged by jumping, indicating that they exploit quite different food resources from those utilized by Leiothrix despite their foraging spaces overlapping to some extent. In the deciduous broadleaved forests of Kyushu, an avian guild of foraging aerial insects in intermediate and lower layers of the forests is poor. Such a community may be subject to the successful invasion of the Red-billed Leiothrix into native forests.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Amano, H. E. & Eguchi, K. (2002b). Foraging

Consequently, the concern now is that infected individuals from these populations, and other undiagnosed populations, may serve as vectors for Bd to naïve populations of native frog. This observation of Bd infection is notable for several reasons.
First, it represents the first record of Bd in L. berlandieri in California. Lithobates berlandieri is expanding its range in the deserts of the American southwest (Rorabaugh et al. 2002), and also occurs in sympatry with other native aquatic amphibian species such as Anaxyrus punctatus, A. woodhousei, and A. alvarius, Pseudacris hypochondriaca (pers. obs.).",Low,"Studies show the first record of Bd in L. berlandieri, however it does not directly show transmisson to local species",NA,Not specified,NA,NA,EICAT_Lithobates berlandieri_12012021_accepted.xlsm

The physical disturbance of soil and leaf litter immediately reduced the abundance and taxonomic richness of macroinvertebrates, those that inhabit leaf litter being more affected than generalists and soil dwelling taxa. However, the influence was short-lived: the abundance of generalist and soil dwelling taxa was similar to that of individuals in undisturbed areas within 21 days. Similarly, a longer-term experiment found no evidence of impact on invertebrates after approximately two months. Next, I used a multi-scale survey to determine how the magnitude of the effect of superb lyrebirds on invertebrate assemblages varied across different spatial scales. While their effects on invertebrates were profound at small spatial scales and short timeframes, they were weaker over longer timeframes and at intermediate and landscape scales. In general mesoinvertebrates showed a weaker response to the presence of superb lyrebirds than did macroinvertebrates. Thus, although superb lyrebird scratching causes obvious changes to the structure of the forest floor of Tasmanian wet eucalypt forests; it appears that their disturbance is neither frequent nor intense enough to result in lasting changes in biotic communities.",Medium,"There is some observational evidence to support the assessment, but while their

Myiopsitta monachus,Monk Parakeet,Kingdom of Spain,Barcelona,(1) Competition,MC - Minimal concern,"The aim of this study was to examine habitat selection in Monk Parakeets during the colonization of Barcelona, Spain, from 1992 to 1994. The Monk Parakeet showed a great selectivity in habitat choice, contrasting with the generalist behavior of the species in South America. The species inhabited urban parks with edible plants and palms (Phoenix spp.). Individuals showed a great specificity and pref-erence for nesting in palms and palms appeared to be the main factor influencing the distribution and abundance of parakeets. Individuals showed a consistent preference for nesting in the tallest palms, probably as a way to reduce predation and human disturbance, although other characteristics also could affect the nest location. Implications of these findings for the biology and management of the species are discussed. No ecologically similar birds occur in this area, and thus we assume that Monk Parakeet habitat selection was not constrained by competition with other species.The Monk Parakeet population in Barcelona may be a source population from which birds disperse to surrounding nonurban areas (see Clavell et al. 1991) where the species could become an agricultural pest and, more impor- tantly, have a strong impact on the native biotasee.

However, it seems likely that the monk parakeet will continue to colonize the favourable areas in Spain, and the potential for at least some negative impacts clearly exists. If no action is considered until serious problems are detected, probably by then, such action may be difficult to be realized. This model should at least be considered as a first warning of future range expansion, and probably more severe troubles to come, which warrants a close monitoring of monk parakeet popula- tions in Spain.

I have never seen a songbird intimidated by a parrot at a feeding station, but there are very few songbirds in Brooklyn to begin with.
When food is scattered on the ground where Monk Parakeets are present, it is typical that other urban birds, including pigeons, sparrows, and starlings, will come to the food first, because the Monk Parakeets seem to use these birds to test the safety of the feeding grounds. Only when it appears that no predators are setting up an attack do the Monks join the group, and even then, they remain highly vigilant. On these occasions I’ve never seen the Monk Parakeets harass the birds they are feeding with.
So do they compete for food? Certainly. Do they prevent the other birds we typically find in Brooklyn from getting enough? In find this unlikely.

Osteopilus septentrionalis,Cuban Treefrog,United States,Florida,(1) Competition,MN - Minor,"""In this study I used experimental manipulations to examine the competitive effects of the larvae of two widely introduced anurans, the cane toad, Bufo marinus, and the Cuban treefrog, Osteopilus septentrionalis, on the growth and development of the larvae of two native anurans (the southern toad, Bufo terrestris, and the green treefrog, Hyla cinerea). The presence of O. septentrionalis larvae consistently impacted growth and development of native larvae, resulting in reduced growth rates and delayed metamorphosis of both native species and smaller mass at metamorphosis of B. terrestris. Hyla cinerea larvae transformed at greater body masses when reared with the rapidly transforming nonindigenous species as a result of competitive release. The negative effects of O. septentrionalis on native larvae were generally significant whether native tadpoles were exposed to O. septentrionalis alone or in combination with B. marinus. [...] Neither nonindigenous species significantly decreased the survivorship of native larvae, although a trend toward decreased survivorship was evident for H. cinerea.

Indeed, worms displayed little interest, i.e., random movement was apparent, when exposed to all nonhylid hosts.

The results of our host specificity experiments are supported by our field collections, which found infections primarily in O. septentrionalis, with a single infection occurring in H. cineria, whereas H. versicolor and all nonhylids were uninfected. Thus, it appears that worms on the FSC campus rely on O. septentrionalis to play host, but occasionally infect H. cineria.

Interference took three forms: (1) removal of the nest lining, (2) removal or pecking of eggs, and (3) removal or pecking of nestlings. House Sparrows removed the nest lining from nests on six occasions, and were responsible for 20 deaths of nestling swallows. We suspect sparrow 
involvement in  15 other deaths of nestling swallow and 42 broken swallow eggs. We  did  not observe intraspecific interference (infanticide), although it may have been the cause of some egg losses and nestling deaths.

Bergtold (1913) described how, between 1906 and 1910, 16% of the C. mexicanus eggs and young in nine nest boxes attached to his home in Denver, Colorado, were lost through intense interference by P. domesticus. In addition, many nests were also lost, in spite of Bergtold's persistent removal of P.  domesticus with a shotgun. More recently, Evenden (1957) studied the nesting success of C.  mexicanus at his home in Sacramento, California. From 1950 to 1954, P. domesticus was responsible for nest failure in 29% of 48 C. mexicanus nesting attempts, with 5 abandoned and 9 destroyed.

Two sections of a large swallow colony under a bridge with House Sparrows were compared in 2007 to two sections with little House Sparrow usage. Nesting success of Cliff Swallows (percent of nests yielding at least 1 chick) was 61% in sections with low House Sparrow activity, significantly higher than the 30% in sections with high House Sparrow activity. House Sparrows defended a broad zone surrounding their nests from Cliff Swallow nesting attempts. We compared the proportion of nests used, clutch sizes, and brood sizes of Cliff Swallows in two colonies in 2008, one with and one without House Sparrow activity. In the colony without House Sparrow activity, 48% of old and new nests were used by swallows versus only 8% in the colony with House Sparrows. Swallow clutch sizes were similar in the two colonies, but swallow brood sizes in the colony with no House Sparrows were significantly higher, mean 52.3 nestlings per nest (mode 52; 75th percentile 53) compared to 0.8 nestlings (mode 50; 75th percentile 51) in the colony with House Sparrows.

Passer domesticus,House Sparrow,U.S.A.,NA,(1) Competition,MC - Minimal concern,"Results from investigations on different scales are interpreted with an assessment of the scales on which the competitors perceive habitat and each other. Interference competition between the introduced house sparrow (Passer domesticus) and native house finch (Carpodacus mexicanus) observed at backyard nest boxes for 4 yr in the western United States may have resulted in habitat segregation on a larger scale along a rural-urban habitat gradient. Competition may be occurring in the eastern states since the introduction of C. mexicanus in 1940. Christmas Bird Count data were examined for patterns in species abundance predicted by competition theory, using three scales of investigation: local (area 24 km in diameter), regional (area 250 km in diameter), and continental (between areas of sympatry and allopatry). The major findings suggest that competition has not influenced patterns of changes in the abundances of the competitors on a local scale in urban and rural habitats in the eastern United States or on a regional scale in the eastern and western United States. On a continental scale, the presence of C. mexicanus may have accelerated widespread declines in the density of P. domesticus in areas of sympatry across the United States, possibly because of the energetic demands of interference competition. The dissimilar behavior and foraging strategies of the competitors may permit coexistence in all habitats, such that the niche of P. domesticus is included in the niche of C. mexicanus. Differences in the perception of habitat by the competitors may preclude the development of habitat segregation along a rural-urban habitat gradient. A multi-scale approach to evaluating interspecific competition suggests that investigations on any single scale (e.g., a field experiment) may overemphasize or miss the importance of competition.",Low,"Whilst there is some observational evidence, it is difficult to establish the extent and severity of competition impacts in the U.S.A.","Recent Breeding Bird Surveys (conducted by the United States Geological Survey and the Canadian Wildlife Service) suggest that House Sparrow populations in the United States are in decline, possibly due to competition from introduced House Finches.",Haemorhous mexicanus,NA,"Bennett, W.

Perdix perdix,Grey Partridge,Kingdom of Denmark,NA,(3) Hybridisation,MN - Minor,"The grey partridge (Perdix perdix) has been an important European game species for centuries, widely subject to translocation and stocking. After c. 80 years of releasing reared grey partridges in Denmark, this study investigated whether an indigenous Danish grey partridge still existed. If so, they would (1) belong to the western European clade (W1) and (2) be more closely related to the historical, indigenous grey partridges than to farm-bred partridges. These predictions were tested by analysing the variation in both the mitochondrial control region (CR1) and microsatellite markers in museum samples representing the ancestral indigenous Danish grey partridge, contemporary wild grey partridges and farmed grey partridges from the five largest farms in Denmark. The European grey partridge has two evolutionary lines that comprise two genetically different sub-species, Perdix p. perdix (western form) and Perdix p.
lucida (eastern form). These lines originate from two different glacial refugees – the Pyrenees and Iberian
Peninsula (western form) and the Balkan/Caucasus region (eastern form). Phylogeography and population structure analyses showed traces of the indigenous Danish grey partridges amongst recent wild partridges in certain areas and significant genetic differences between farmed partridges and historical and recent partridges. The results also showed that the indigenous Danish grey partridges belonged to the western European clade (W1 haplotype). A foreign stocking effect was detected on the remote island of Bornholm, where the current population originated from introduced Danish and Bohemian grey partridges. The loss of haplotype diversity over time in certain geographical areas probably results from serious declines in wild Danish grey partridge numbers in recent decades. This, combined with the observation that hybridization between released stocked and wild partridges can occur, may complicate recovery of partridge populations. The study suggests that the genetic relationship of the recent wild birds is closer to the historical birds than to the birds reared on farms. However, as the most common haplotype W1 is found in all study areas and farms, it is not possible to evaluate whether further introgression between
stocked and present, wild partridges has occurred and the consequences of such a process in other areas.

strongly  compete  for  resources  with  Tasman  parakeets,  there  is  only  limited  evidence  of  competition for feeding resources at present. Both species exhibit significant seasonal changes in patterns of habitat use and preferences. Likewise, both species show significant changes in food types and feeding species.

An introduced parrot, the crimson rosella (Platycercus elegans), is thought  to  compete  strongly  with  Tasman  parakeets  for  nesting  and  feeding  resources, however, the degree of competition for feeding resources has not been quantified. No study has aimed at understanding the selection of available habitats by Tasman parakeets and crimson rosellas, or the relevance of restored vegetation patches for these species for foraging activities. 
In order to provide information to better manage a growing population of the Tasman parakeet within the Norfolk Island National Park, it is important to understand patterns of habitat use and key resources, as well as the degree of competition with the introduced crimson rosella. I studied the habitat use of Tasman parakeets and crimson rosellas during two seasons, autumn and spring 2017 by surveying 986  vegetation plots. I encountered a total of 80  woody  plant species occurring on nine habitat types. The highest plant species richness was in forest edges (70  species),  followed  by  remnant  hardwood  forest  (43  species).  The  lowest  plant  species richness was on regenerating vegetation patches (26 species). Tasman parakeets and crimson rosellas  used  these  habitats  differently.  In  autumn  and  spring,  Tasman  parakeets  preferred remnant hardwood forests (Manly Selectivity Index autumn: 0.50; Chi square 6.86, P < 0.001, n = 35; Manly Selectivity Index Spring: 0.32; Chi square 6.86, P < 0.001, n = 55).  Crimson rosellas preferred forest edge in autumn (Manly  Selectivity  Index Autumn: 0.34; Chi square 24.51, P < 0.001, n = 69) and remnant hardwood in spring (Manly Selectivity  Index Spring: 0.28; Chi square 4.56, P < 0.001, n = 130). In terms of feeding species, Tasman parakeets and Crimson rosellas exhibited a high degree of overlap in only one food type: ake ake (Dodonea viscosa) seeds and fruits. Opportunistic observations during summer, revealed a similar degree of  overlap  for  consumption  of  seeds  and  pulp  of red  guava  (Psidium  cattleianum),  although habitat preferences for summer or winter were not quantified in this study. I did not register a single instance of aggressive interactions between Tasman parakeets and crimson rosellas after nearly 300 hours of field observations. My results indicate that Tasman parakeets and crimson rosellas used the available habitats in the Norfolk Island National Park differently. In terms of foraging resources, Tasman parakeets and crimson rosellas do not appear to overlap greatly in food types or feeding species during autumn and spring. While there has been evidence (prior to this research) of intense competition for nesting cavities between Tasman parakeets and crimson rosellas, my research  reveals  little  inter-seasonal  overlap  in  habitat  use  and  feeding  resource.  From  a 
management  perspective,  control  of  crimson  rosellas  in  an  around  nest  cavities  of  Tasman parakeets should  be  favoured  over  control  on  foraging  areas.  Nevertheless,  crimson  rosellas outnumber Tasman parakeets 3:1, and therefore my results need to be interpreted with caution as it is unclear whether foraging and habitat use patterns consistent with my research would be encountered in the future, as numbers of Tasman parakeets continue to increase.

Platycercus eximius,Eastern Rosella,New Zealand,NA,(1) Competition,DD - Data deficient,"We studied the nesting ecology of the most successful psittacine invader, the Eastern Rosella (Platycercus eximius), in the North Island. Rosella nest-site use was investigated at the microhabitat, macrohabitat, and landscape scales. The number of potential nesting sites available in an area and proximity to fresh water were important determinants of occupancy of nest sites by Rosellas. In urban areas where mature, cavity-bearing trees were rare, Rosellas were observed using alternative nesting sites in tree ferns. This apparent flexibility in nesting behaviour may have contributed to the success and spread of Eastern Rosellas within New Zealand. Studies of cavity-nesting bird communities elsewhere support the suggestion that introduced species can both successfully compete for the use of nesting sites, and induce further partitioning of cavity resources. It is possible that exotic cavity-nesting birds may be having a similar effect on native New Zealand species, or may do so in the future as populations expand and overlap.

It is desirable to assess whether a non-native species will have a negative impact at an early stage in the invasion process, when management options such as eradication are still available. Although it may be difficult to detect early impacts of non-native species, it is necessary to ensure that management decisions can be based on case-specific scientific evidence. We assess the impacts of a non-native bird, the Black-headed Weaver Ploceus melanocephalus, at an early stage in its invasion of the Iberian Peninsula. To do this we identify potential pathways by which competition for shared resources by Black-headed Weavers could lead to population declines in two ecologically similar native species, and generate hypotheses to test for evidence of competition along these pathways. Fieldwork was conducted at four sites in western Portugal. Black-headed Weavers could potentially impact native species by displacing them from nesting habitat, or by reducing habitat quality. We found no evidence for either potential competition pathway, suggesting that Black-headed Weavers do not currently compete with the two native species.

Psittacula alexandri,Red-breasted Parakeet,Singapore,NA,(8) Grazing/herbivory/browsing,MC - Minimal concern,"Red-breasted parakeets began spreading across mainland Singapore and offshore islands (Pulau Ubin and Pulau Sakijang Bendera [St. John‘s Island]; Lim & Gardner, 1997; Lim, 2009), with much evidence of breeding.The red-breasted parakeets  have  been  observed  feeding  on  seeds  from  several  trees  and  plants (see Table 2): African tulip, Spathodea campanulata (BESG, 2007d); simpoh air, Dillenia suffruticosa* (BESG, 
2009c); rose of India, Lagerstroemia speciosa (BESG, 2011b). On farmlands within their native range, the Tanimbar corella and red-breasted parakeet raid maize and rice fields in  huge  flocks  (Forshaw,  1973;  Long,  1981),  and  have  been  known  to  damage  up  to  50%  of  the  crops  (Jepson  et  al., 2001).  In  Singapore,  these  parrots  mostly  fed  on  ornamental  plants  such  as  the  cassia  or  golden shower  (Cassia fistula;  BESG,  2009a),  the  pong  pong  (Cerbera odollam;  BESG,  2009b),  and  leucaena  (Leucaena leucocephala;  BESG, 2010a),  as well as on two species of native plants (Table 2). However, plant damage caused by these aliens has not been reported in Singapore, and the paucity of information makes it difficult to assess their potential ecological impact.  The  red-breasted  parakeet  has  been  observed  to  use  its  strong  bill  to consume the entire unripe fruit of simpoh air (BESG, 2009c), and this selective removal of immature fruits may lead to lowered recruitment of native plants.Again, detailed studies on seed predation by alien parrots will be necessary to determine their ecological impact.",Low,"Whilst there is some observational evidence, it is difficult to establish the extent and severity of herbivory impacts.",NA,Dillenia suffruticosa,NA,"Neo, M.L.

krameri may contribute to niche expansion and invasion success of P. eupatria. These two parakeet species, which are closely related and rather similar in appearance, may form mixed-species flocks and/or join communal roost sites. Single individuals or small nuclei of P. eupatria may potentially benefit of this association by predator avoidance nd/or information transfer (e.g. on foraging, nesting and roosting locations; sensu Ward and Zahavi 1973) from an established population of P. krameri. Such associations, together with parrot longevity (Costantini et al. 2008), may also increase individual survival, potentially giving single P. eupatria more chances to encounter potential partners, e.g. after new releases.

Psittacula eupatria,Alexandrine parakeet,Spain,NA,(12) Indirect impacts through interactions with other species,DD - Data deficient,"The Rose-ringed Parakeet Psittacula krameri, is an invasive species widely spread across Europe, including Spain. The Alexandrine Parakeet Psittacula eupatria is also an invasive species established in Europe, but not in Spain, although some species distribution model classified parts of Spanish as ‘highly suitable’ and an invasion risk assessment predicted a ‘high risk of invasion’ in Europe. The first hybrids from these two species were recently detected in Spain. Based on these data, we suggest to capture the hybrids to prevent further invasion and possible interaction with other invasive parakeets in Spain.It is rare that there is so much information available about the invasive potential of one species, as the first sighting was recorded. So, this is a great opportunity to prevent a new introduction of parakeets, in a country with 21,000 already established feral parakeets, where the management measures, when applied, are technically and economically challenging. In conclusion, we recommend considering this sighting as an ‘early warning’ and taking serious action based on the precautionary principle. The early capture of the hybrids, as a part of the ‘rapid response’ mechanism, would avoid unpredictable consequences (i.e., spread a new invasive species or increase the population growth rate of the RRP).",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Postigo, J.-L.

We analysed the relationships between four invasive alien fleshy-fruited plants, Clidemia hirta, Rubus alceifolius, Lantana camara, Schinus terebinthifolius, and an invasive alien bird, the red-whiskered bulbul Pycnonotus jocosus introduced to Reunion Island (Indian Ocean). We compared the distribution of food items in the bulbul diet according to seasons and to abundance classes of this bird. Pycnonotus jocosus is mostly frugivorous and frequently eats the main alien plants (more than 80% frequency of food items). Sites with alien species, such as Clidemia hirta, providing fruits throughout the year supported more birds than sites providing fruits, such as Schinus terebinthifolius, seasonally. The birds facilitated seed germination by removing the pulp of fruit: the final per cent germination (FG) of cleaned seeds was higher than those within the fruit for three of the four plant species and in some cases passage through birds significantly increased FG (Schinus terebinthifolius) or Coefficient of Velocity (CV) (Lantana camara)",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Mandon-Dalger I et al.

Endemic Hawaiian birds occurred in native-dominated forests as low as 120 m elevation. Non-native species were detected at all survey locations. We observed non-native Saffron Finch Sicalis flaveola, previously unrecorded in Puna. Variable circular plot surveys of Kahauale’a Natural Area Reserve indicated the disappearance of two native species (’I’iwi Vestiaria coccinea and ’O’u Psittitostra psittacea), and two non-native additions (Red-billed Leiothrix Leiothrix lutea and Kalij Pheasant Lophura leucomelana) to the study area since the Hawai’i Forest Bird Survey conducted in 1979. We present evidence that native ’Elepaio Chasiempsis sandwichensis has experienced a decrease in population density and an elevational range contraction since 1979.

Streptopelia decaocto,Eurasian Collared-dove,U.S.A.,Texas,(1) Competition,MN - Minor,"Nest observations took place on the campus of Wayland Baptist University, in Plainview, Hale County, Texas. On 17 April 2014, D. Niler Pyeatt (DNP) observed a pair of American Robins begin construction of a nest in a fork of a cottonwood (Populus deltoids) tree at a height of ,10 m. On 22 April, a collared-dove began to take interest in and approach the nest and was observed sitting in the nest when the robin was absent. Upon returning to the nest, the robin would wait nearby and resume occupation of the nest when the collared-dove left the nest rather than chasing the collared-dove away. From 22–24 April, the collared-dove visited the nest with increasing frequency and began to chase the robin off the nest throughout the day on 24 April. The collared-dove would land on a branch next to the nest with the robin and puff its chest and flap its wings rapidly (described by Romagosa 2012) until the robin left the nest. The collared-dove would occupy the nest while the robin sat nearby. The robin occupied the nest when the dove left, but was repeatedly evicted by the collared-dove. By 25 April, only the collared-dove was observed on the nest, and the robins were seen in the vicinity for brief duration only twice that day. After 25 April, the robins were not observed near the nest usurped by the collared-dove, which continued to occupy the nest.

The linear correlations for both species approach significance (both near p = 0.05) with a positive relationship between Mourning Dove trends and Collared-Dove trends and Collared-Dove recent abundance. This suggests that, if anything, circles with the greatest increases in Collared-Doves were more likely to have also experienced an increase in Mourning Doves.

Collared-Doves are largely restricted to rural, rural-residential, and some suburban areas (Hampton 2006, Bonter et al. 2010, Fujisaki et al. 2010, Veech et al 2010, Romagosa 2012). In contrast, Mourning Doves are habitat generalists, show complete overlap with the habitats occupied by Collared-Doves, as well occurring in open grassland, large open agricultural areas, dense suburban and urban habitats not used by Collared-Doves. Therefore, it is possible that Collared-Doves are having a negative impact on Mourning Doves within those shared habitats, limiting Mourning Doves to habitats not used by Collared-Doves, and thereby masking the local impacts at the scale of a full CBC circle.

Starlings were effective competitors for Acorn Woodpecker holes, and the number of individuals breeding increased during the study.

Sturnus vulgaris,Common starling,North America,NA,(1) Competition,MC - Minimal concern,"Quantitative studies are typically limited in size, time and space. So, multiple studiescanhelp to establish general patterns of interactions between an introduced species and a range of native species. For instance, competition for nesting sites from Common Starlings has been well studied in North America and seems not to be a threatening process. Troetschler (1976) found that the Acorn Woodpecker (Melanerpes formicivorus) out-competed Common Starlings for hollows, readily excavated new hollows, or successfully nested or re-nested later in the season and maintained local populations, which was taken to indicate that the Common Starling was not reducing the fecundity of the native species. Vierling (1998) observed 59 pairs of the Lewis’s Woodpecker (Melanerpes lewis) at their nest-hollows and only one hollow was lost to Common Starlings. A series of studies (Ingold 1989, 1994, 1996, 1998) showed that in urban and rural areas, the Common Starling competed successfully with native woodpeckers. In one case, competition with the Red-bellied Woodpecker (Melanerpes carolinus) was intense; 52% of hollows were lost, leading to a significant reduction in fecundity (Ingold 1989). However, for this species and the Red-headed Woodpecker (Melanerpes erythrocephalus) and Northern Flicker (Colaptes auratus), re-nesting and moving into more heavily forested areas where the Common Starling was sparsely distributed were successful strategies to reduce competition with the Common Starling. There was no evidence for reduced fecundity of the Mountain Bluebird (Sialia currucoides) or Tree Swallow (Tachycineta bicolor) in the presence of the Common Starling, although the Tree Swallow did shift its nesting niche (Koch et al. 2012). Notably, analysis of long-term (30+ years) bird distribution datasets for 27 native, hollow-nesting species (including the Red-bellied Woodpecker) showed that only one common species, the Yellow-bellied Sapsucker (Sphyrapicus varius), had a population decline plausibly owing to competition with the Common Starling (Koenig 2003).

",British Columbia,(1) Competition,MN - Minor,"European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) introduced to North America compete with native cavity-nesting birds for nest sites. On average, 7% of flicker nests each year were usurped by starlings; daily probabilities of takeover declined through the season but were relatively low (1–2%). Using eq. 4 to plot expected fitness using the average Trenest and observed Pevict in the flicker population showed a function that declined almost linearly. In all cases, fitness declined early in the season but takeover probabilities 75% that declined steeply were sufficient to cause rising expectations of fitness later in the season.

The percent of flicker nests destroyed by starlings may underestimate competition between the two species. For example, flickers could lose contests over nests early in spring before eggs are laid. Such situations would still
force delays in nesting, but without evidence of a cavity takeover. Quantifying the number of actual conflicts
between flickers and starlings may be difficult because agonistic encounters over cavities could be brief and
infrequently observed. There may also be more subtle effects of renesting on the reproductive success of flickers.",Low,"Whilst there is observational evidence, it is difficult to establish the extent and severity of competition impacts in British Columbia.",NA,Colaptes auratus,NA,"Wiebe, K.

tection of starlings. However, at least as many of these increased rather than decreased following starling colonization, including Red-bellied Woodpeckers, one of the only species for which there exists good evidence of a
high frequency of nest usurpation by starlings. As a secondary cavity-nesting species, Eastern Blue-
birds are vulnerable to starling competition for nest cavities. Overall trends for this species in the BBS data were
negative during the 1966—1979 period, but this has been attributed to severe winters and spring storms, not nest-
site competition (Gowaty & Plissner 1998). In fact, over the longer 1966—1993 period, trends in the BBS data
were positive for this species (Gowaty & Plissner 1998). Similarly, Red-cockaded Woodpecker nests can be
usurped by starlings, but in general starlings are not considered sufficiently dangerous to warrant discussion in
management plans for this endangered species, in contrast to Pileated Woodpeckers, which are known to be a
serious threat to Red-cockaded Woodpecker nesting and roosting cavities.

",NA,(1) Competition,MN - Minor,"This paper exames factors which could influence the breeding success of native parrots in savannah and wood- land areas in which substantial populations of the intro- duced hollow-nesting sturnids, myna Acridotheres tristis and starling Sturnus vulgaris, are present. The two exotic sturnids were shown to be the dominant users of available nest resources (nest-boxes and natural hollows) in the study sites. The myna was successful in most aggressive encounters with starling and the two native parrots during the period of nest-site selection and occupancy. There was evidence of partitioning of nest resources between species in the different areas and habitats available. The exotic sturnids, particularly the myna, demonstrated the potential to reduce the breeding success of the native parrots studied. The starling was only noticeably successful in agonistic encounters against the eastern rosella, winning 69% of such encounters. The eastern rosella won the majority of its encounters with the red-rumped parrot. Ambrose (1982) found that the red-rumped parrot in and around Melbourne engaged in many agonistic encounters with starlings and usually lost these (lost 80%, 12 of 15 encounters). Such outcomes may be of importance in determining the use of smaller hollows, not accessible to myna and crimson rosella. It is known (Moeed & Dawson, 1979) that entrance diameters < 45 mm exclude myna but allow access to starling. Overall, the study has generated strong circumstantial evidence of the potenial of the introduced sturnids, particularly the common myna, adversely to affect the breeding success of crimson and eastern rosellas in savannah and woodland areas, particularly those close to urban centres. Both introduced sturnids were major users of natural hollows, with the starling probably making greater use of hollows of smaller entrance diameter. In this respect, starlings may have an important influence on the breeding success of the red-rumped parrot.",Low,"Whilst there is observational evidence, it is difficult to establish the extent and severity of competition impacts in Australia.",NA,"Platycercus eximius, Psephotus haematonotus",NA,"Pell, A. & Tidemann, C., (1997).

European Starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) and Red-bellied Woodpeckers initiated nests in late March and early April; Red-headed Woodpeckers nested during the first week of May. Most competition for freshly excavated nest sites was between starlings and Red-bellied Woodpeckers. Fifty-two percent of Red- bellied Woodpecker nest cavities and 7% of Red-headed Woodpecker nest cavities were usurped by starlings. Differences in nest-site parameters of the woodpecker species appeared to influence starling choice of cavities. Pairs of Red-bellied Woodpeckers unable to avoid starling competition suffered apparent reductions in fecundity. Ultimately, pairs able to avoid starling competition in March and April should be at a selective advantage.

Sturnus vulgaris,Common starling,North America,NA,(1) Competition,MO - Moderate,"Quantitative studies are typically limited in size, time and space. So, multiple studies can help to establish general patterns of interactions between an introduced species and a range of native species. For instance, competition for nesting sites from Common Starlings has been well studied in North America and seems not to be a threatening process. Troetschler (1976) found that the Acorn Woodpecker (Melanerpes formicivorus) out-competed Common Starlings for hollows, readily excavated new hollows, or successfully nested or re-nested later in the season and maintained local populations, which was taken to indicate that the Common Starling was not reducing the fecundity of the native species. Vierling (1998) observed 59 pairs of the Lewis’s Woodpecker (Melanerpes lewis) at their nest-hollows and only one hollow was lost to Common Starlings. A series of studies (Ingold 1989, 1994, 1996, 1998) showed that in urban and rural areas, the Common Starling competed successfully with native woodpeckers. In one case, competition with the Red-bellied Woodpecker (Melanerpes carolinus) was intense; 52% of hollows were lost, leading to a significant reduction in fecundity (Ingold 1989). However, for this species and the Red-headed Woodpecker (Melanerpes erythrocephalus) and Northern Flicker (Colaptes auratus), re-nesting and moving into more heavily forested areas where the Common Starling was sparsely distributed were successful strategies to reduce competition with the Common Starling. There was no evidence for reduced fecundity of the Mountain Bluebird (Sialia currucoides) or Tree Swallow (Tachycineta bicolor) in the presence of the Common Starling, although the Tree Swallow did shift its nesting niche (Koch et al. 2012). Notably, analysis of long-term (30+ years) bird distribution datasets for 27 native, hollow-nesting species (including the Red-bellied Woodpecker) showed that only one common species, the Yellow-bellied Sapsucker (Sphyrapicus varius), had a population decline plausibly owing to competition with the Common Starling (Koenig 2003). Overall, there is strong corroborative evidence for a lack of population-level effect of competition for nesting sites from the Common Starling on native birds.",Low,"Whilst there is observational evidence, it is difficult to establish the extent and severity of competition impacts in North America.",NA,"Melanerpes carolinus, Sphyrapicus varius",NA,"Baker, J., Harvey, K.

",NA,(1) Competition,MO - Moderate,"European Starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) were introduced to New York City in 1890 and have since become one of North America’s most common species. Starlings are aggressive competitors and commonly usurp cavities of other hole-nesting species. These characters make it a clear choice for a species whose invasion is likely to have significantly affected native cavity-nesting birds. Using Christmas Bird Counts and Breeding Bird Surveys, I compared the mean densities of 27 native cavity-nesting species before and after invasion of sites by starlings. Contrary to expectations, only 10 of the species exhibited significant effects potentially attributable to starlings, and only half of these were in part negative. However, in 2 of the 5 species that showed negative effects, evidence for a decline in one analysis was countered by an increase in the other, whereas in 2 others declines were likely due to factors other than starling competition. Only sapsuckers (Sphyrapicus spp.) exhibited declines potentially attributable to starlings that were not countered by other data. Although declines may still occur if starlings continue to increase, the results of this study fail to support the hypothesis that starlings have had a severe impact on populations of native birds. These results highlight the difficulties of predicting the impacts of invasive species. Native hole-nesting birds have thus far apparently held their own against the starling invasion, despite the latter’s abundance and aggressive usurpation of often limited cavities.",High,There is observational evidence to support the assessment.,NA,Sphyrapicus varius,NA,"Koenig, W.D., 2003.

",Ohio,(1) Competition,MO - Moderate,"In this study, several flicker pairs in areas of starling overlap (at least 37%) that lost nest cavities to starlings in late April and early May, undertook a second nest effort in June or July, often in the same cavity tree or in another tree in the immediate area. However, the fecundity of late-nesting pairs was lower than that of starling-free pairs; more- over, when I arbitrarily divided all clutches into those completed before and after 1 June, the early nesters produced significantly more offspring. Ingold (1996) reports that early clutches, nestling numbers and fledgling numbers from flicker pairs studied from 1990- 1992 and 1994-1995 in this area also were significantly larger than clutches, nestling numbers and fledgling numbers from late- nesting pairs. Thus, although flickers may routinely renest later in the season if their initial effort is disrupted (see Short 1982, Moore 1995, Winkler et al. 1995), they may still be at a reproductive disadvantage since their fecundity is reduced as the nesting season progresses. It is probable therefore, that flickers are subjected to opposing selection pressures. The stronger of these selection pressures remains to be determined; even so, it is clear that European Starlings are having a significantly adverse effect on the reproductive success of Northern Flickers in Ohio.",High,There is observational evidence to support the assessment.,NA,Colaptes auratus,NA,"Ingold, D.

Fruit abundance Peaked in March and April, and most fruit was either red/orange or purple/black. The physical parameters of adventive and indigenous fruits were not significantly different. Six of the 15 passerine species netted are frugivores, and of those netted 77% had eaten fruit. They were divisible into three groups: endemic (bellbirds, Anthornis melanura; tuis, Prosthemadera novaeseelandiae), non-endemic but indigenous (silvereyes, Zosterops lateralis), and adventive (blackbirds, Turdus merula; song thrushes, T. philomelos; starlings, Sturnus vulgaris). Bird diets varied between the groups and according to fruit availability as determined by sires and seasons. Endemic birds ate the least adventive fruit; bellbirds ate mainly Podocarpus hallii and Coprosma robusta fruits at all sites. Tuis had a varied diet, including some adventive fruits. Silvereyes ate the widest range of indigenous and adventive fruits. Blackbirds and, to a smaller extent, song thrushes ate many of the same indigenous fruits as the other bird groups, but their diet included more adventive fruits, e.g., Berberis glaucocarpa. Starlings were caught only when they fed on Sambucus nigra, but they also ate a few indigenous fruits. There was little seasonal variation in bird numbers caught.

Turdus merula,Eurasian Blackbird,Australia,Victoria,(12) Indirect impacts through interactions with other species,MC - Minimal concern,"Invading Pittosporum undulaturn tends to be clumped around the butts of established trees. This is due to the preferential deposition of seeds in these sites by the European blackbird (Turdus merula) which is believed to be the main vector of dispersal. Native silvereyes (Zosterops lateralis) eat some seed but are not considered important in dispersal. The high mortality of seedlings in exposedsites reinforces the patchy pattern originally dictated by seed dispersal. Seeds may germinate after seed fall in spring but most seeds germinate in autumn. No seeds germinate during summer because of the low rainfall and high temperatures, the optimum germination temperature being 18-21°C . After 16 months' storage at moderate temperatures and humidities, 80% of seed was still viable but viability was reduced to 30% at very low humidities. Seedlings of P. undulatum have three growth stages. The juvenile and transitional stages last 6-12 months and have alternate leaves. In the adult phase a terminal vegetative bud forms at the stem apex. Bud burst may occur several times a year in seedlings and twice a year in fruiting adults. The seedling root habit varies with soil type. The seedlings are able to coppice if the shoot is removed P. undulatum is an aggressive invader of eucalypt forests despite the poor survival of the initial colonizers. The formation of a regeneration niche ensures the survival of succeeding generations.

We reviewed available information on dispersal of fleshy-fruited environmental weeds in New Zealand. Blackbirds, silvereyes and starlings are probably the most important dispersers; they are the most widespread birds, and all disperse more than 20 weed species. Starlings pose additional risks because they disperse seeds long distances to roost sites, including offshore islands. The kererū
is a significant disperser of weed seeds also, and the key disperser for three species with large, single-seeded fruits. Most seeds are likely to be dispersed less than 100 m by birds, with some dispersed hundreds of metres or even several kilometres (by birds and mammals). Reducing the spread of fleshy-fruited weeds via animal ingestion is challenging. Potential management tools include reducing invasive mammal abundance and seed availability using traditional or biological control (particularly in populations that are major seed sources for dispersal to high value sites), providing alternative native food sources by planting natives that fruit at peak weed fruiting times, and targeting favoured roost sites for surveillance and control.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Wotton, D.

Together with the native silvereye (Zosterops lateralis) they are the major seed dispersers over large areas of New Zealand. I review the international literature on aspects of the ecology and behaviour of blackbirds relevant to their potential for dispersing weeds in New Zealand. Blackbirds eat a wide range of native and exotic fruit including many naturalised species. Their habitat preferences and behaviour result in germinable seeds being deposited in a range of sites, particularly in shrubby habitats, where seedling establishment is likely. Most seeds will be deposited within 50 m but some may be carried a kilometre or more to develop new invasive loci. Blackbirds therefore probably make a major contribution to the development of novel plant communities of naturalised woody weeds. These communities provide fruit more suited to non- endemic native birds and naturalised birds, than to endemic birds. The relative contribution of blackbirds and silvereyes to seed dispersal of native and exotic species requires investigation. The outcome may suggest potential for managing blackbirds as a vector of weed invasions.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Williams, P. A. (2006).

Density data indicate that competition was more widespread, with loss of tens of thousands of native birds in the 5371 ha area surveyed. Our results are consistent with the view that ecological barriers may delay the population increase of invaders and that human-derived activities may help invaders cross these barriers by creating new ecological opportunities. Control of white-eye numbers may be essential for recovery of native species. hanges in native birds in the forested areas. Figure 4 shows significant declines in native birds the same years that the white-eye was increasing in both the open and closed forest areas. The declines in the closed forest area were smaller than those estimated in the open forest area (Fig. 4, paired t = 2.15, df =7, p = 0.034). However, the high correlation between changes in density in the two forest areas (cor = 0.93, p = 0.0003), including white-eyes, indicates that the pattern of changes among native species and white-eyes was similar in the open and closed forest areas. Table 1 shows that tens of thousands of native birds perished even under the most optimistic scenario. Based on mean 2000 densities times 3373 ha, there were approximately 166, 927 native birds in the open forest area. The loss of 61, 289 birds represents a 37% decline, ranging from 51 to 22%. The closed forest area had 86, 653 birds with a loss of 9091, representing a 10% decline. The white-eye was the only bird that significantly increased in each area. Our data also presage connections between biotic resistance, diffuse competition, and a reversal of diffuse competition through propagule pressure.

Zosterops japonicus,Mountain White-eye,U.S.A.,Hakalau Forest National Wildlife Refuge,(1) Competition,MO - Moderate,"Here we document strong community-wide competition from the Japanese white-eye (Zosterops japonicus) on native Hawaiian passerine birds. Introduced in 1929, white-eye successfully invaded old- growth forest and coexisted with eight native species , overlapping multiple foraging substrates with each but evidencing no agonistic interactions. The endangered Hawaii akepa (Loxops coccineus coccineus) was viable during 1987–1999 but became nonviable during 2000–2006 in association with an abrupt increase in white-eyes. We show that after 2000, juveniles of every native bird species measured had lower mass and shorter bills and tarsi. For most species, lower mass led to decreased juvenile survival, and shorter bills to decreased survival of second-year and older adults. Lower survival of smaller birds represents normalizing selection that is restoring previous size means to future generations. Birds at a nearby site with fewer white-eyes had normal size. We measured bill length, tarsus length, and mass of seven
species of native Hawaiian birds and introduced Japanese white-eyes (Zosterops japonicus) during 1987–2006 in Hakalau Forest National Wildlife Refuge on the Island of Hawaii. Morphological changes in native juveniles were precisely associated with the increase in white-eyes beginning in 2000. White-eye had less stunting of bills and did not suffer the survival consequences of native species. Exploitative competition for food between native birds and an introduced species requires intensive management to prevent further declines. The Hawaii akepa, Hawaii amakihi (Hemignathus virens virens), and Hawaii elepaio, native species with bill sizes similar to the white-eye, had both lower apparent juvenile and lower second-year survival. The iiwi (Vestiaria coccinea), which shares the most common foraging substrate with the white-eye, had lower apparent second-year survival. The Hawaii creeper (Oreomystis mana), which forages for arthropods on bark rather than gleaning arthropods on foliage, had slightly lower apparent juvenile survival.

Role  of  the  white-eye  in  the  widespread  decline  of  the  Hawaii  akepa: The  three  sites  in the  former  high-density  area  of  the  akepa,  where  mist-netting  efforts  were  conducted during  both  time  periods,  had  similar  community  structure  (minus  akepa  and  white-eye) (Morisita’s  Index  of  Similarity =0.98,  0.97,  0.97).

The  only  potentially  viable  population  was  at 1650 m, which had the lowest proportion of white-eyes. The viabililty is based on mass of fledglings.  Medeiros  and  Freed  (in  press)  showed  that  fledglings  that  weighed  11  g  or  more survived as well as adults. When the akepa population at the 1900 m site was viable, 30% of fledglings were of high quality and the proportion dropped to 16% after 2000. The 1770 m site, used during 2004–2005, had only 14% high-quality fledglings. In contrast, the 1650 m site  had  40%  high-quality  fledglings  during  2004–2005.

During recent decades, the introduced generalist Japanese White-eye (Zosterops japonicus) has become the most common bird in Hawaii. The movements of avian frugivores largely dictate how far seeds get dispersed and into what kinds of microhabitats. This study compares the movement patterns and diet of the Oma‘o to the Japanese White-eye to understand how a native differs from a non-native frugivore in the type and distances of seeds dispersed. Radiotelemetry was conducted on nine Oma‘o and nine Japanese White-eyes in a system of natural forest fragments (k""ıpuka) created by lava flows. Japanese White-eyes disperse seeds approximately twice as far as Oma‘o; during the time of gut passage, Oma‘o move a mean distance of 98.1 m, and Japanese White-eyes move 170.1–194.8 m. However, the Oma‘o disperses the seeds of at least seven different native fruit species compared with two dispersed by Japanese White-eyes. Japanese White-eyes were found to disperse seeds smaller than 15 mm, whereas the Oma‘o dispersed seeds up to 6 mm in diameter. Despite their ecological differences, both birds distribute certain seeds within and among k""ıpuka and likely facilitate primary succession of fruiting plants in the young lava matrix. However, this study suggests that if the Oma‘o were extirpated, a smaller-bodied generalist cannot entirely substitute for the ecological role played by the native frugivore.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Wu, J.

Zosterops japonicus,Mountain White-eye,Japan,Bonin Islands,(12) Indirect impacts through interactions with other species,DD - Data deficient,"Abstract The disruption of plant–animal interactions such as seed dispersal is one of the most critical effects of biological invasions. To understand the role of introduced species in current seed-dispersal systems, we conducted fecal analyses of the most common resident land birds on the Bonin Islands, Japan, and estimated their relative importance as seed-dispersal agents. Two native birds, the brown-eared bulbul and the Bonin Islands white-eye, and the introduced Japanese white-eye were the primary seed dispersers in secondary forest sites. Because the seed species composition in the feces of native and introduced white-eyes was similar, the latter may be replacing the former as a seed-dispersal agent. Introduced plants did not decrease the number of seed- dispersal opportunities for native species through com- petition for seed dispersers. Because some bird species have already become extinct on the Bonin Islands, their ecological functions may also have been permanently lost; however, the introduced white-eye may be com- pensating for this loss of function. In addition, new mutualistic relationships involving native and intro- duced birds and plants have already been established. In order to control introduced species while having the least impact on the native biota, interspecific interactions must be thoroughly understood before initiating control efforts. Approximately 100 years have passed since the introduction of the Japanese white-eye (Momiyama 1930), and a new mutualistic relationship between the introduced bird species and the native ecosystem has already established. Although there have been harmful effects on the native ecosystem, the introduced white-eye has likely become an essential component of the current ecosystem after long-term naturalization. The disap- pearance of the introduced white-eye may lead to further declines in native plants through the lack of a seed-dispersal agent.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Kawakami, K., Mizusawa, L. & Higuchi, H.

The results of this study demonstrate how Japanese white-eyes, and possibly other non-native birds, are dispersing predominantly non- native seeds under dry forest trees. This is occurring to the almost complete exclusion of native tree species, which are subsequently experiencing dispersal failure by falling mainly beneath parent trees. Potential long-term effects could include a shift from a native to alien-dominated forest community.

Introduced birds did have a strong and conspicuous impact on native and non-native plants. In an ecosystem where most native frugivores are extinct, introduced birds dispersed all common native plants in these forest sites but non-native plants were infrequently eaten and dispersed. Furthermore, introduced birds are effectively dispersing native seeds from native forest into adjacent sites currently dominated by non-native plants, allowing native forest to reestablish.

The shade-tolerant invasive tree does not require disturbance or deforestation to facilitate invasion, and is notable for its ability to invade into high elevation forests where human impacts are minimal. Two frugivores increased consumption of M. calvescens fruit at highly invaded sites and decreased consumption of other dietary items. The endemic fruit dove, Ptilinopus purpuratus, consumed more native fruit than either of the two introduced frugivores (the red-vented bulbul, Pycnonotus cafer, and the silvereye, Zosterops lateralis), and introduced frugivores showed a low potential to act as dispersers of native plants. Network patterns on the highly invaded island of Tahiti were dominated by introduced plants and birds, which were responsible for the majority of plant–frugivore interactions.
