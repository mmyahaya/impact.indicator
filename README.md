# Impact indicator of Invasive Alien Species
This repository provides codes to compute impact indicators of Invasive Alien Species using open data

The impact of invasive alien species is recognised as one of the leading drivers of biodiversity loss, significantly disrupting native ecosystems. This repository provides several types of impact indicator by integrating GBIF occurrences cube and the Environmental Impact Classification for Alien Taxa (EICAT) scoring system. Alien species causes impact at various magnitude, through different mechanisms and regions. This repository is a step towards automated impact indicator to track impact of alien species.
